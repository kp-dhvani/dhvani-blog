						Introduction: The script-agnostic nature of Sanskrit
					</h2>
					<p>
						Open any Sanskrit text and you might see it written in elegant
						Devanagari curves, stark Bengali angles, flowing Thai loops,
						geometric Tibetan calligraphy, from right to left or from top to
						bottom. Why? Because Sanskrit doesn't belong to any one script. It
						belongs to all of them. Sanskrit started as an oral language and
						didn't have a writing system of its own for a really long time. You
						might say that all languages are oral and that's true but for most
						of Sanskrit's life it was never written down. Sure, writing came
						much later than spoken languages and that's true for all languages.
						But here's the difference: some languages got their on custom made
						writing system. For
						<abbr title="example">eg.</abbr> Cuneiform is a writing system that
						developed in ancient Mesopotamia around 3400-3200
						<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>. The earliest cuneiform
						tablets are primarily administrative records tracking livestock,
						grain, and other commodities. Over several centuries, it evolved
						from pictographic signs into a full writing system capable of
						expressing complete texts in Sumerian and later adapted for
						Akkadian, Hittite, and other languages. Egyptian Hieroglyphs were
						invented around the same time as Cuneiform. The first attested
						script used to write Chinese was the Oracle Bone script dating back
						to 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>.
						It was already in a fully functional and mature state when we first
						saw it due to its highly abstract nature and consisting of major
						types of Chinese characters. Apart from Cuneiform, Hieroglyphs and
						Oracle Bone script were already in a mature state when we discovered
						them which clearly implies an earlier period of development of
						several hundred years.
						<br />
						So what <em>makes</em> Sanskrit different? Sanskrit, by contrast,
						was never given a purpose built script as it has always borrowed and
						adapted existing writing systems. The primary script used to write
						Sanskrit is called Devanāgari but was not invented for writing
						Sanskrit. During it's lifecycle various scripts have been used to
						write Sanskrit. Some of the scripts used to write Sanskrit are:

						<h2 class="underline mb-2">Devanāgari: The Abugida script</h2>
						<section>
							<p>
								Sanskrit now is primarily written in Devanāgari which is an
								Abugida script. An Abugida is a writing system where each basic
								symbol represents a consonant with an inherent vowel and form a
								consonant-vowel unit. Each unit is based on a primary consonant
								and a secondary vowel. Vowels are indicated by modifying marks
								to the base consonant using something called as diacritic marks.
								This is how it works for Devanāgari:
							</p>
							<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
								<li>
									Each letter = consonant + default vowel. In the case of
									Sanskrit the default vowel is "a".
								</li>
								<li>
									To write other vowels you add marks to the consonant. In
									Devanāgari the sign for the vowel following a consonant is
									then added to right, to the left, above or below the consonant
									sign.
								</li>
								<li>
									To write just a consonant (no vowel) you use a special mark
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Example: Base consonant क = "ka"
								<br />
								To write different vowels with क
							</p>
							<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 my-2">
								<li>कि = add mark ि for ki</li>
								<li>की = add mark ी long "ī" kī</li>
								<li>कु = add mark ु for ku</li>
								<li>कू = add mark ू for long "ū" kū</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="mb-5">
								<b>There is no sign indicating the vowel: a</b>. It is the most
								frequent vowel in Sanskrit and seemed most economical to have
								its presence <em>assumed</em> whenever no other other vowel was
								explicitly present.
								<br />
								To write just क "k" with no vowel: क्
								<br />
								In Devanāgari the mark ् to indicate the absence of a vowel is
								called a Virāma a small diagonal stroke below the consonant
								sign.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-5">
								This works well for when a consonant has a vowel but what
								happens when a consonant is instantly followed by another
								consonant? Such consonants are called
								<em>Conjunct consonants</em> where two or more consonants appear
								together without a vowel between them. In English words like
								<em>street ("s", "t", "r" together)</em>,
								<em>spring ("s", "p", "r" together)</em>,
								<em>play ("p", "l" together)</em> are a form of conjuncts.
								<br />
								For conjuncts in Devanāgari, using Virāma is done almost
								exclusively at the end of words whose last sound is a consonant.
								In other cases we need to combine the two consonants in writing.
								This can be achieved by omitting the right hand vertical element
								of the first sign. Example:
								<br />
								maṇḍalaḥ -> circle
								<br />
								Here ṇ has no vowel and is followed by another consonant ḍ.
								<br />
								ण् ṇ + ड् ḍ = ण्ड् -ṇḍ-
								<br />
								मण्डल: -> circle
								<br />
								Let's look at another example:
								<br />
								ātmā -> soul
								<br />
								त् + म् = त्म् -tm-
								<br />
								आत्मा -> soul
								<br />
								Sometimes a letter does not have a vertical element or cannot be
								combined with the next letter for some reason. In such cases
								letters are made smaller and stacked on top of one another.

							<ul class="list-none space-y-2 mb-5">
								<li>द् d + म ma = द्म dma</li>
								<li>द् d + भ bha = द्भ dbha</li>

								The name Abugida comes from the Ethiopian Ge'ez script and is
								formed from the first four syllables
								<em>'ä, bu, gi, da</em> similar to how we say
								<em>a, b, c, d</em> in English. Abugida is one of the three
								major writing system types. In an <em>Alphabet</em> (like
								Latin/English) vowels have equal status to consonants and have
								separate letters. The word "alphabet" comes from the first two
								Greek letters <em>alpha</em> and <em>beta</em>. In an
								<em>Abjad</em> (like Arabic or Hebrew) only consonants are
								written with vowels absent or marked optionally.

								Devanāgari: The Modern Face of Sanskrit
							</h2>
							<p>
								The word <em>Devanāgari</em> is formed by combining two words:
								<em>deva (देव)</em> meaning a male deity or divinity and
								<em>nagari (नागरी)</em> which is an adjective derived from
								<em>nagara (नगर)</em> meaning town or city which can be used to
								talk about an urban city. Perhaps it was named as the script was
								associated with religious texts but Sanskrit had a larger
								atheistic literature than exists in any other classical
								languages including Greek, Latin, Arabic, Chinese, etc. So
								Devanāgari being the script of the divinity does not hold true
								in any sense. The exact meaning of the word is unclear as to why
								was the script named this way.
								<br />
								Devanāgari today is used to write 3 major languages: Hindi (more
								than 500 million speakers), Marathi (around 80-90 million
								speakers), and Nepali (around 15 million speakers). As we have
								seen above, Sanskrit in its lifetime was written in many
								different scripts but in the modern era Sanskrit texts are
								printed and shared mostly in Devanāgari. So, the question arises
								why Devanāgari?
								<br />
								Indian literary traditions historically were largely oral where
								writing played a secondary role. Most written records from the
								pre-modern era were in the form of inscriptions and manuscripts.
								Despite the established and highly cultivated manuscript
								tradition of India, typography was a European import to the
								region and the technology was designed around the Latin script.
								Latin centrism led to modifications in the stacked conjuncts and
								vowel diacritics as they were easier to represent linearly in
								typography. The earliest evidence of printed Devanāgari comes
								from the 1667 book <em>China Illustrata</em> published by German
								Jesuit Athnasius Kircher which compiles 17<sup>th</sup> century
								European knowledge on the Ming era Chinese empire and its
								neighbouring countries which includes India. He himself had
								never been to China but compiled the oral and written reports
								from former Jesuit missionaries to publish the knowledge on
								China and Tibet. However, the Devanāgari in the book was printed
								using woodblock engraving and not metal movable types.

								Although Portuguese had begun printing in India around middle of
								the 16<sup>th</sup> century, they did not use Devanāgari type
								and font for printing. Metal font casting in Devanāgari was
								carried out mostly in Europe by Germans and British scholars.
								Devanāgari printing in India would have to wait a few centuries
								until the end of 18<sup>th</sup> century.

								When the British arrived in India, they had 3 cities in mind to
								setup their base - Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Mumbai was under
								the Portuguese control and also made them vulnerable to
								resistance from Marathas who were at that time the strongest
								opposing force in the country. Chennai was too far from the
								north so would have been a difficult place to setup a trade
								base. Kolkata, named Calcutta by the British however has a weak
								Mughal ruler Siraj-ud-Daulah. After winning the battle of
								Plassey in 1757 against Siraj-ud-Daulah and the Battle of Buxar
								in 1764 against against the combined armies of Shah Alam II, the
								Emperor of the Mughal Empire; Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal;
								Balwant Singh, the Maharaja of the Benares State;
								Shuja-ud-daula, the Nawab of Awadh, the East India Company
								transitioned from traders to landlords gaining control of all
								Bengal. The defeated Indian rulers were forced to sign the
								treaty, granting the East India Company Diwani rights, which
								allowed them to collect revenue from the territories of Bengal,
								Bihar, and Orissa on behalf of the Mughal emperor. Kolkata was
								rich and educated with significant advantages. The area provided
								abundant supply of fertile land, fish, and meat. The river Ganga
								opened the floodgates of opportunities by setting up ports for
								business through the river which connected to the Bay of Bengal.
								They could also setup inroads without bothering Portuguese who
								controlled Mumbai, Goa, Cochin, and Pondicherry. Hence, Kolkata
								became the capital of the British trade company.
							</p>
							<p>
								Soon Europeans who would come to Kolkata began to study the
								local culture and languages. Sir William Jones a British
								philologist and a judge who served in Kolkata founded the famous
								<em>The Asiatic Society</em> to enhance and further the cause of
								<em>Oriental research</em> which in this case was India and its
								surrounding region. Some of the early members were Charles
								Wilkins and Alexander Hamilton. In his famous
								<em>Third Anniversary Discourse to the Asiatic Society</em>
								delivered on February 2 1786 he made the groundbreaking
								observation about the relationship between Sanskrit, Greek, and
								Latin. His famous statement was:
							</p>
							<blockquote
								class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white"
							>
								<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
									"The Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a
									wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious
									than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet
									bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots
									of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have
									been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no
									philologer could examine them all three, without believing
									them to have spring from some common source, which, perhaps,
									no longer exists: there is a similar reason, though not quite
									so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the
									Celtick, though blended with a very different idiom, had the
									same origin with the Sanscrit, and the old Persian might be
									added to this family, if this were the place for discussing
									any question concerning the antiquities of Persia."

								<em
									><span class="underline">An important note</span>: Jones was
									not the first one to make this observation. As early as 1653,
									Dutch scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn had published a
									proposal for a proto language and in 1767 the French Jesuit
									Gaston Laurent Coeurdoux had demonstrated the analogy between
									Sanskrit and European languages. However, Jones' discourse is

								Although, Bengal had its own script - Eastern Nagari script also
								known as Bengali-Assamese script, the British expanded further
								west into <em>Hindustani</em> speaking territories making
								'Hindustani' texts part of their research in Kolkata. Few East
								India Company officials (EIC) like English Orientalist Nathaniel
								Brassey Halhed had already learned the Bengali language and
								wanted to print a book on the Bengali grammar but couldn't
								because there were no typeface available. Enter Charles Wilkins
								(co-founder of asiatic society) and Bengali blacksmith Panchanan
								Karmakar who developed the first ever metal cast for Bengali in
								1778. The significant stride made was in 1778 with the book
								<em>A Grammar of the Bengal Language</em> by Halhed printed in
								the press of a Mr. Andrews at Hooghly, a small town about 25
								kilometers from Kolkata. Wilkins designed the typeface and
								Karmakar physically cut the punches and cast the type.

								typography. The Karmakars - based in Tribeni in Hooghly
								specialised in calligraphy and were well known for inscribing
								names and decorations on copper plates, weapons, metal pots,
								etc. In fact one of his ancestors was very popular for carving
								designs on swords and shields which earned him the title of
								<em>Mullick (Malik/Mallik)</em> from one of nawabs
								(deputy/viceroy) of Bengal Alivardi Khan who ruled Bengal from
								1740 to 1756.
								<br />
								Jones initially took the initiative of making Bengali typeface
								in England but it proved too expensive and the end result was
								not up to mark. After looking for quite some time he got in
								touch with Panchanan Karmakar, the blacksmith who had already
								mastered the art of Bengali calligraphy on metal. Panchanan
								created the Bengali typeface for the press which was finally
								used to print Halhead's book A Grammar of the Bengal Language.
