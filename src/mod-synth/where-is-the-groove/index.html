					A couple of months ago I went to this "bush techno" gig in a hidden
					warehouse. To my surprise, my friends and I left in 30 minutes after
					reaching to the venue. The music was decent but no matter how much I
					tried I could not move my body to it and honestly I could not explain
					why moving my body to it was so hard. I am not a dancer and have only
					recently started to go out to gigs for dancing. I am a massive techno
					fan because so far in my experience of listening to different
					sounds/music genres techno and house are the only two genres to which
					I can move my body to. After attending a variety of events with
					different genres I realised I can't really move my body to anything
					else than house/techno. I still listen to a lot of other
					"non-dancable" genres but if I am going out for a dancing I only
					attend house/techno events. The only thing I could say about the music
					in the warehouse to my friends was
					<span class="italic">"It's not groovy"</span>. The whole experience
					made me think about groove and what exactly does it mean when someone
					says <span class="italic">"the music is groovy"</span>? Where does
					groove come from? Is there a way to measure groove in music? What
					makes something groovy and something else not so groovy? How does it
					differ from rhythm? Well let's dig in and see if we can find answers
					to these questions I have.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">What is groove?</p>
				<p>
					Humans have an inclination to move with music. Be it subtle foot taps
					and head nods or with full on dance moves we feel this urge to somehow
					sync to the music we are listening to. Steve Gadd one of the best
					known drummers in Jazz says about groove
				</p>
				<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
					<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
						I've found over the years that the feel overcomes everything. If you
						get a good groove happening, that carries it along. If it feels
						good, there's not a lot you have to do. You can pick and choose your
						spots to dynamically respond to what's going on, but you don't have
						to technically, constantly challenge yourself to fill in those
						spaces.

					How should we define the term <span class="italic">"groove"</span>?
					The word has been in the vocabulary of musicians in popular music for
					a number of decades but has only recently been introduced in the
					theoretical realm where it remains subjected to a variety of
					interpretations. Well let's try to get some theoretical definitions
					out of the way. Groove as a musical quality is an important part of
					genres like Jazz, Hip Hop, modern Pop and dance music. It is an aspect
					of the music that compels us to move and that this feeling is
					generally regarded as pleasurable. With regard to universality to
					groove in different cultures: the Brazilian word
					<span class="italic">balanço</span>, the Japanese word
					<span class="italic">nori</span>, and the Swedish word
					<span>svängig</span> are terms with similar meaning to groove.
					<br />
					> Groove is often called the "feel of music".
					<br />
					> Groove can loosely be called "the feel of a rhythm".
					<br />
					> Groove is principally a property internal to music itself and arises
					from collected effects of various forms of musical nuances especially
					in regards to microtiming.
					<br />
					> In music theory groove refers to the rhythmic properties of pieces
					of music and/or the timing relationships of actions of individuals
					interacting with the music.
					<br />
					> From the musicians' perspective groove is commonly referred to a
					pleasing state in which the creation of music becomes seemingly
					effortless and they define groove as a verb instead of a noun. When
					playing in a group the groove may be experienced when the interaction
					between the instruments becomes seamless and the music feels right
					subjectively. Or they could say that it is related to the rhythmic
					feel of a piece of music, how the individual parts or layers of the
					music interlock and interact with each other to create a unified
					rhythmic effect.
					<br />
					<br />
					The meaning of the word also varies depending on how the term is used
					grammatically i.e. as a noun, adjective, or verb. A groove is as a
					noun could refer to a repetitive pattern as well as a feeling that is
					pleasing and induces body movement. To groove could mean playing
					together in an effortless manner. Though the word groove has a long
					history in the field of music making its occurrence in the books on
					popular music theory is rare. The second edition of The New Grove
					Dictionary of Jazz defines groove as "a persistently repeated
					pattern". Jeff Pressing a psychologist and music researcher says
					groove can be defined as a kinetic framework for reliable prediction
					of events and time pattern communication. Let's understand what that
					means here. Kinetic refers to the physical movement of motion. Groove
					transfers energy from musicians to listeners through predictable
					patterns that generate momentum. Perceptual and productive rivalries
					are established against a stable framework. What are rivalries here?
					It is a neurological phenomenon where competing ideas form in our
					brains for a sensory stimulus. It means that while a single stimuli is
					presented the perceived image or sound in this case will switch
					between two distinct perceptive ideas of what the stimulus is. An
					optical illusion is a good example of a visual rivalry. Ok what about
					perceptual rivalries? This means we hear the music in two different
					ways at once. One example is Queen's We Will Rock You song pattern:
					Stomp-Stomp-CLAP, Stomp-Stomp-CLAP. Is the clap the main beat or the
					stomps? So what's a productive rivalry? Also called Binocular rivalry,
					in this phenomenon the brain alternates between perceiving two
					different stimuli to each sensory organ even if those stimuli are not
					inherently conflicting. In music this means our heads can move to one
					beat but our foot or hips can move to some other beat.
					<br />
					<br />
					Another definition comes from musicologist Richard Middleton who
					summarises groove as understanding of rhythmic patterning that
					underlines its role in producing the characteristic rhythmic feel of a
					piece, a feel created by repeated framework within which variation can
					then take place.
					<br />
					Ethnomusicologist Charles Keil who has gone so far to introduce a new
					branch of study called "groovology" based on this theory of
					"Participatory Discrepancies" or PDs. For him groove is a process
					rather than a thing, a verb than a noun. Keil acknowledges the
					traditional view that expressivity of music and its meaning is rooted
					in its musical syntax especially in the Western art music repertoire
					yet he claims that syntax does not explain the expressivity of many
					other forms of music performance around the world. His idea of
					expressivity of music includes substantial proportions of
					improvisation (eg. Jazz) and spontaneity, music that is a process and
					music that has groove i.e. music that motivates a motor response in
					listeners. In his book published together with Steven Feild
					<span class="italic">Music Grooves</span>, he says participatory
					discrepancies - deviations from precise metronomic timing
					relationships as a central source of groove. He says "everything has
					to be a bit out of time, a little out of pitch to groove" and is
					therefor the fundamentally imperfect result of a collaborative
					process. These subtle timing variations can include:
					<br />
					- Playing slightly ahead and/or behind the beat.
					<br />
					- Varying the duration of notes
					<br />
					- Shifting accents within rhythmic patterns.
					<br />
					- Creating micro timing differences between instruments.
					<br />
					These discrepancies aren't random but meaningful expressive choices
					that create tension and release. They are what makes music alive,
					rhythmic, and engaging rather than mechanically precise.
					<br />
					<br />
					Musicologist David Brackett combines a number of ideas to define
					groove. First, groove is a feature of the Western African musical
					tradition. Second, it is the result of a relaxed and flexible attitude
					to the underlying metronomic pulse. Third, that those definitions
					should suggest "too positivistic a formula". What he means by the
					third point is not to take the definitions as a complete scientific
					formula that fully explains a groove. Musical concepts like groove
					cannot be perfectly defined through objective and scientific analysis
					alone. He adds:
				</p>
				<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
					<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
						Discerning why some bands "groove" more than others is a complex
						affair. ... a groove exists because musicians know how to create one
						and audiences know how to respond to one. Something can only be
						recognised as a groove by a listener who has internalised the
						rhythmic syntax of a given musical idiom.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Musicologist Vijay Iyer provides a qualitative description of groove.
					In groove contexts musicians display a heightened microscopic
					senitivity to musical timing anf these musical quantities combine
					dynamically and holistically to form what some call a musician's feel.
					He says groove based music features a steady virtually isochronous
					pulse that is established collectively by an interlocking composite of
					rhythmic entities and is either intended for or derived from dance.
					That's a very technical definition of what a groove is so let's unpack
					it. He says for music to be groovy there has to be a consistent
					underlying beat that listeners can predict and follow, isochronous
					meaning equal time intervals between beats. The spacing has to be
					virtually (almost perfectly but not mechanical) regular. NO single
					instrument can create groove, it is a collective effort of various
					instruments to create the pulse with each instrument contributing to
					the overall rhythmic foundation. To be groovy each instrument has to
					play different rhythmic patterns on the main pulse and the distinct
					rhythms interlock together like puzzle pieces. Thin of it like this:
					kick drum on beats 1 and 3 (strong beats), snare on beats 2 and 4
					(backbeats), bass with a complex pattern using 8<sup>th</sup> or
					16<sup>th</sup> notes, and hi hats on steady 8<sup>th</sup> or 16<sup
						>th</sup
					>
					notes. Each sound occupies different rhythmic spaces.
					<br />
					The groove then gives rise to the perception of steady pulse in a
					musical performance and it engages the "walk" (locomotor) channel of
					the listener's sensorimotor system giving rise to entrainment.
					Entrainment is when our body's internal rhythm synchronises with an
					external rhythmic stimulus. So, basically when we automatically lock
					in with the music because the music is so groovy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ok so that's a lot of theoretical definitions for groove and that is
					one way to define groove. Groove as an inherent property of music and
					something that exists in the music itself and is characterised by a
					steady pulse, micro timing deviations, participatory discrepancies,
					interlocking rhythmic patterns, etc. which we call the "feel of the
					music". Music has a groove, the feeling which accompanies after
					perceiving the sound of music is a by product of our apprehension of
					music's groove through our bodies.
					<br />
					But what happens when I listen to something that has all of the
					aforementioned characteristics and still not be able to move my body
					to it and be able to dance to it? One account groove is the feel of
					the music and on the other groove is the psychological feeling which
					is induced by music of wanting to move one's body. The first account
					can be termed as
					<span class="italic">"groove as feel"</span> and the other can be
					termed as <span class="italic">"groove as movement"</span>.
					<br />
					Both concepts involve rhythm and body but groove as a feel is more of
					a technical craft. For instance if two drummers play the exact same
					beat but one hits the snare 20 millisecond behind the beat (laid-back
					feel) vs exactly on time. Think of a chef using their knife skill to
					perfectly cut a piece of meat - the technique of how they cut not
					whether the cooked meat tastes good.
					<br />
					<br />
					Historically groove research began in the humanities i.e. mainly in
					the fields of musicology, ethnomusicology, and philosophy with a focus
					on rhythmic microtiming deviations in recent years the scope has
					broadened and usage of empirical methods to study groove mainly in
					psychology and neuroscience. Here researchers are applying statistical
					methods which enabled them to find general tendencies related to how
					people experience groove. In case of groove as a movement it can be
					roughly defined as the feeling generated by music that induces bodily
					movement and centering the psychological inquiry on the movement
					inducing feature of groove is well supported. Petr Janata a
					neuroscientist, has conducted an excellent study understanding how
					various characteristics of groove are perceived by listeners among
					other things. The participants were asked to agree or disagree
					(strongly or otherwise) with a number of claims about groove and the
					claim that "groove depends on the extent to which the music makes you
					want to move" is the most strongly agreed aspect of groove for the
					participants. Below is the complete survey response.

					There are a lot of researchers who are inquiring into the psychology
					of groove without committing to any set of musical features as the
					centre of their research. Instead they are looking for explanations on
					what musical nuances and features cause us to move our bodies
					involuntarily to a particular rhythm. The traditional research into
					groove was centered on what musical nuances and features define groove
					and this is a theory first approach. The groove definitions mentioned
					above had a philosophical/theoretical belief on what groove must be.
					Their reasoning was: groove feels human and alive while machines are
					quantised and rigid hence groove must come from human imperfection
					i.e. subtle timing variations. But groove as a movement focuses
					primarily on groove being a psychological phenomenon conveying that
					groove is the feeling within the listener not the feel within the
					music. This is not to say the the musical nuances are not at all
					needed for someone to groove with a piece of music since musical
					features like tempo, syncopation, pulse clarity, etc do lead to
					increase in the overall perceived groove which I will discuss later in
					the article. We can then make this assumption that:
				</p>
				<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
					<li>Groove can and is understood in multiple ways</li>
					<li>
						That the musical features associated with one concept need not be
						associated or form the basis of both the concepts of groove
					</li>
					<li>
						Both the ideas are not mutually exclusive and a failure to
						distinguish between them can lead to one of the two errors:
						<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
							<li>That musical nuances form the basis of groove as movement</li>
							<li>
								That the research from the psychology of groove as movement
								disproves the musical nuance theory of groove as feel
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Petr Janata in his study theorises groove as a "pleasurable drive
					toward action" that results from sensorimotor coupling i.e. engagement
					of the brain's motor action system while listening to music (more on
					this later) and that induces a positive affective state. Groove as a
					psychological phenomenon then shifts the focus on the degree to which
					a given rhythmic music leads to experience of wanting to move and/or
					some form of pleasure of enjoyment. With this approach groove can be
					associated with any musical style that involves such experiences
					regardless of cultural origin. However, if we compare genres groove
					for African American styles of funk, jazz, hip hop, etc. as well as
					West African, Afro Latin, Afro Cuban, etc. tend to receive higher
					ratings for dancing or pleasure than other styles of music which kind
					of coincides with the musical nuance (music as feel) definition of
					groove. Groove does not only occur within individuals but also between
					people shared by musicians, dancers, audiences. It draws multiple
					individuals into the same space and synchronises their movement which
					may blur boundaries between the people.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Why do we groove?</p>
				<p>
					The brain is mostly for movement. We think of ourselves as rather
					intelligent creatures. We like to believe that our brains are capable
					of deep, wonderful, imaginative thoughts but reaching out to pick up a
					cup of tea and bringing it our mouth without spilling isn't something
					we boast about. Not all organisms have a brain. Plants, bacteria,
					jellyfish, etc do not have a brain so why do we need one? The primary
					need for brains is to coordinate movement. Sound, sight and other
					sensory information is brought together, processed and the result is
					used to move the muscles to achieve the goals of the organism i.e.
					eating and not getting eaten. Well trees do not move and they do not
					have brains. Yes and plants in general demonstrate that you can be
					incredibly complex without a brain but they just solve problems on
					different timescales. A tree can decide which direction to grow its
					branches, allocate resources between leaves and roots, prepare
					chemical defences, etc. but these decisions happen over days, weeks,
					or seasons rather than milliseconds. Imagine a predator trying to
					approach you and your body takes a whole season to decide to run away
					in the other direction. Movement creates the need for split second
					decisions that require centralised processing power and brains have
					evolved to do the same. The primary evolutionary pressure for
					developing brains was the need to rapidly integrate and process
					sensory information and coordinate motor response basically to save
					our lives or to drink a cup of tea without spilling it. So,
					coordinating much needed movements was the job of the brain and not
					building highly abstract models. High abstract models are conceptual
					frameworks that operate far away removed from our physical reality.
					Math, numbers, metaphysical theories, ethics, morality, quantum
					mechanics, linguistic... The list goes on and on. Abstract thinking
					piggybacks on motor systems i.e. it can be called as sort of a
					spandrel of motor systems. Our spine also does thinking for us
					sometimes. We don't always need our brains to move. Eg. touch
					something hot accidentally and in a split second you will snatch your
					hand away. Temperature sensors in the skin have quickly signalled to
					the spine and the local neurons in the spine have already decided to
					trigger the withdrawal movement for the hand. Anything beyond a reflex
					movement will need the brain to process the stimulus. Such reflexes
					are called spinal reflexes abd the brain is bypassed when such
					decisions need to be taken in milliseconds. When it comes to
					coordinating movement we have to talk about cerebellum. It is like an
					extra mini brain at the back.
				</p>
				<div class="flex justify-center my-10">

				</div>
				<p>
					The cerebellum is densely packed and contains 80% of all the neurons
					in the brain. It is dedicated to the job of coordinating movement and
					sensation. It makes sure motor movements run smoothly. Let's say you
					try to reach out for that cup of tea next to you but your body is
					already busy. There are muscles holding your posture, holding your
					head, and keeping you balanced. When you're going to reach out for
					that cup it's going to change your centre of gravity. The reach of the
					arm needs to be fitted in with everything else that is your body doing
					so that the overall movement of the reach is smooth and flows well
					together with your body. Doing all of this takes a lot of integration
					and monitoring of the sensory input and adjusting the motor system
					output. Some heavy duty processing is required here that takes a lot
					of neurons and the cerebellum is here to do that. Yet you only notice
					when things go wrong and the cup does not reach your lips and you
					spill the tea.
					<br />
					But now that we are creatures with highly developed brains, movement
					is not the only specialty of our brains and now they have to deal with
					highly abstract models living in the modern world. Cognition has
					overtaken as primary function of our brains but that is not
					necessarily true. Cognition in a way is movement. For example "paying
					attention" would be said to be a cognitive activity but when doing
					that what our brains are still engaged in movement related processes.
					When we pay attention to an object let's say, the following brain
					regions light up:
				</p>
				<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
					<li>
						Sensory circuits: Process the incoming sight/auditory information
					</li>
					<li>Spatial systems: Map where everything is in relation to us</li>
					<li>
						Motor systems: Prepare the actual movements (especially eye
						movements)
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					But what about let's say paying attention in a class? It's technically
					not a physical object that one pays attention to if they are sitting
					in a class paying attention to what the teacher is teaching. Here's
					the thing what we think of attention as mental focusing power without
					any physical component is not what it is in the brain. We can not
					think of something in abstract i.e. to pay attention to anything our
					brain has to prepare our body to interact with it physically. Even
					when we are paying attention to an abstract idea in a lecture our
					brain is still
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
					<li>
						Planning eye movements to track the location of the lecturer, or the
						board, or the notes
					</li>
					<li>
						Preparing head orientation to face the source of the information
					</li>
					<li>Positioning the body to optimise hearing and seeing</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mb-5">
					When we walk through a problem we are literally using the same neural
					circuits that would navigate us through a physical space. When we
					"grasp" a concept we are using circuits that evolved top grasp
					objects. So has cognition or building highly abstract models in the
					brain overtaken movement? Not really, cognition is movement that does
					not move the body. The brain is still planning the same movements but
					with the "execute" button turned off. The brain's primary function
					remains the same: plan and execute the right action but it's just that
					now most of our important actions are thoughts. Which leads us to a
					crucial revelation about our intelligence:
					<span class="underline italic"
						>intelligence is distributed throughout the body not just in the
						brain.</span
					>
				</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Much has been said about the role of the body in cognition. Recent
					development in cognitive science move toward the inclusion of the body
					in our understanding of the mind. Cognitive scientists have begun to
					make connections between the mental processes and physical embodiment.
					This new research is called
					<span class="italic">embodied cognition</span> and treats cognition as
					an activity that is structured by the body in an environment as
					embodied action. Cognition depends on experiences based in having a
					body with sensorimotor capabilities. Sensory processes i.e. perception
					and motor processes i.e. action have evolved together are
					fundamentally inseparable. The traditional view of perception says: it
					is a passive process where your brain receives sensory input,
					processes the information to create an internal model or
					representation of the world, and then decides wat actions to take
					based on the internal model. But embodied cognition view says:
					perception isn't just passive reception of sensory information but is
					fundamentally about guiding our actions in the world. It is an active
					ongoing process that directly guides your actions and your actions in
					turn shape what you perceive.
					<span class="underline"
						>Having a body fundamentally shapes how we think.</span
					>
					As per embodied cognition view the mind is no longer seen as passively
					reflective of the outside world but rather as an active constructor of
					its own reality. Such behaviour is facilitated through a feedback
					mechanism among sensory and motor systems. The temporal information
					from the sensory stimuli is matched to the motor image of the body.
					Our brain has an internal model of how our body moves through time.
					The emergent neural connections between the senses and the motor
					system form the basis for cognition. Neuroscience supports this view.
					If we look at our nervous system as a system that produces motor
					output we can make more sense of embodied cognition. Cerebellum
					contains ~80% of all the neurons in the brain but constitutes only
					~10% of the brain's neurons. It is connected almost directly to all
					the areas of the brain - sensory transmission, reticular
					(attention/arousal) system, hippocampus (memory), limbic system
					(emotions, behaviour). The "mind" thus becomes a
					<span class="italic">distributed</span> entity rather than just
					something residing in the brain. Cognition is seen as distributed over
					mind, body, activity and cultural context. We rely upon various
					attributes of our world, social, and cultural environment to support
					our mental capacities. Jean Lave an anthropologies conducted a study
					to see how adults of various backgrounds used arithmetic while grocery
					shopping. Her results showed that in making purchase decisions the
					subjects employed a flexible real time arithmetic in order to select
					better prices per unit weight, taking into account the constraints
					imposed by the layout of the stores, the capacities of their
					refrigerators, and the dietary requirements of their family members.
					Such use of arithmetic was rarely reflected in subjects' performance
					on grade school math problems. Cognition as demonstrated in practice
					wsa found to differ from cognition in abstract settings. When a bird
					drops a nut from a great height to crack it open does the ground
					become a tool? Rather the bird is exploiting an aspect of its
					environment to extend its physical capabilities. Hence the mind may be
					viewed as symbiotically embedded not within its body but also in that
					body's environment and structured by its surroundings. This embodied
					view of cognitive science allows for direct cultural interaction which
					is crucial for both language and music.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					One might say musical groove is as something that induces motion. Our
					capacity to lock in to a regular rhythm may have been an evolutionary
					leftover from some previously useful survival function. There are
					several compelling theories for this. Groups that could move in sync
					were more effective in hunting, gathering and defending. Being able to
					predict regular temporal patterns help with anticipating animal
					movements during hunting. It also improves fine motor control and
					coordination. Research has shown that the rhythmic component of an
					auditory image i.e. a mental representation of sound that you can
					"hear" in your mind cannot be activated without recruiting neural
					systems known to be involved in motor activity especially those
					involved in the planning of the motor sequences. Our brain is
					constantly trying to predict what will happen next. For rhythmic
					patterns the best way to predict timing is to internally simulate the
					actions that would produce those patterns. When you observe or hear
					actions, mirror neurons fire as if you were performing those actions
					yourself. Music hijacks this ancient prediction system built into our
					minds which is why it feels so physical even you're just listening.
					When we hear or see patterns that have a specific timing and spatial
					arrangement eg. rhythm of music, these sensory patterns align with how
					our bodies naturally move. Our motor systems have a certain natural
					rhythm and preferred patterns of movement. Because of the sensory
					stimuli the brain invokes its internal model i.e. a mental image of
					the movement which corresponds to the synergetic elements of the
					muscoskeletal system even if the muscoskeletal system itself does not
					move. Neurons do not control each muscle individually, they instead
					control a group of muscles called
					<span class="italic">synergies</span>. When the sensory stimuli aligns
					with our body's natural rhythm and match the synergies the whole
					neuron pattern activates internally. The brain has mechanisms that can
					suppress motor output while allowing motor planning and simulation to
					occur which allows us to think about the actions without performing
					them. The muscles may show subtle activation which can be detected via
					electroencephalogram (EEG) but not enough to create an observable
					motion. This simulation stays in the brain rather than being fully
					executed. Remember from the previous section:
					<span class="italic"
						>cognition is movement that does not move the body, the brain is
						still planning the same movements but with the "execute" button
						turned off.</span
					>
					Motor neurons have activation thresholds. When sensory inout matches
					motor patterns it activates these neurons below the threshold needed
					for actual movement creating "subthreshold" motor activation i.e. real
					neuron activity without visible physical output.
					<span class="italic underline"
						>A perceived rhythm is literally an imagined movement.</span
					>
					The act of listening to rhythmic music involves the same mental
					processes that generate bodily motion. For example, certain musical
					characteristics might evoke the dynamic movement of the gradual
					increase/decrease in volume and intensity that naturally occur when
					breathing. Air flows in during inhalation which increases the volume
					gradually expanding our chests fully. Air flows our during exhalation
					which reduces the volume and our chests contract. Orchestral crescendo
					(gradually getting louder) and diminuendo (gradually getting softer)
					can evoke the natural rhythm of breathing. Musical rhythms can also
					evoke the steady pulse associated with walking and rapid rhythms
					associated with speech. These bodily movements have their own
					frequency. Breathing falls in the range of 0.1Hz to 1Hz, steady pulse
					associated with walking falls in the range of 1Hz to 3Hz, and speech
					falls in the range of 3Hz to 10Hz.

					As shown in the table various musical characteristics resonate to our
					natural bodily movements. Musical activity on these timescales exploit
					the corresponding body activity. Most of the wind instrument phrase
					lengths are naturally constrained by the lung capacity; blues
					guitarists, jazz pianists, and
					<span class="italic">quinto</span> players in Afro-Cuban
					<span class="italic">rumba</span> are said to "speak" with their hands
					and fingers. Such instances involve the embodiment of the musical
					performer and the listening audience.
					<br />
					Music isn't just abstract sound patterns, it directly connects to the
					natural rhythms and movements of our bodies. Our cognitive system
					operates on multiple temporal scales simultaneously. Our brains are
					processing different stimuli at different speeds. For example, we are
					simultaneously tracking:
				</p>
				<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
					<li>Slow changes: The overall emotional feel of the conversation</li>
					<li>Medium changes: Rhythm of speech</li>
					<li>Fast changes: The individual phonemes</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Music exploits this natural cognitive architecture. Our brains are
					constantly solving this problem of integrating the information coming
					to it at different speeds. Music provides a clear window into how this
					works because music is a temporal organisation of information which
					our embodied systems can latch on to. When we hear music our motor
					systems do not just respond they actively predict what comes next
					based on the bodily patterns it recognises. THis is why we can
					anticipate musical beats and why disruptions feel surprising. Our
					motor system is actively predicting where the music is going by
					feeling its temporal nature and running simulations in the brain. Each
					of the frequencies mentioned in the table above represent different
					possibilities for actions that our bodies naturally support. Our
					bodies have natural resonant frequencies determined by the things like
					limb length, muscle fibre type, neural processing speeds, etc. Music
					that aligns with these constraints feels "right". Different sensory
					and motor systems (breathing, walking, speaking) operate as integrated
					units. Music succeeds by activating different systems at the same time
					creating a rich, layered embodied experience.
					<br />
					When musical rhythms match bodily rhythms, the natural oscillations in
					the brain synchronises to the rhythms creating coherent patterns of
					activity. This is why music can feel so compelling and why it affects
					mood and attention. Prediction and successful prediction leads to
					rewards in the brain. Music that successfully activates multiple
					bodily systems at once creates a rich satisfying experience. If it's
					too simple then things get boring, if it's too complex then our bodies
					can not follow it. Understanding music isn't just happening in the
					auditory cortex, it involves motor, respiratory, speech, and dynamics
					of breathing itself. While musical styles vary culturally the
					underlying frequency ranges suggest universal constraints based on
					shared human embodiment.

				<p class="underline mb-2">What makes it groovy?</p>
				<p class="mb-2">
					<span class="italic font-bold">Meter</span>: Meter in a piece of music
					is the arrangement of the rhythms in a repetitive pattern of strong
					and weak beats. The rhythms themselves are not repetitive but they
					make a strong pattern of pulses and it on these pulses the beat of the
					music that you tap your foot to, clap your hands, etc. When we walk we
					might go <span class="font-bold uppercase">LEFT</span>-right-<span
						class="font-bold uppercase"
						>LEFT</span
					>-right-<span class="font-bold uppercase">LEFT</span>-right. Some
					steps feel stronger when you push off and some steps feel weaker when
					you just land and this creates a pattern that repeats. Musical meter
					works the same way. Meter can be classified by counting the number of
					beats from one strong beat to the next. For example if the music feels
					like "strong-weak-strong-weak", it is duplemeter. A
					"strong-weak-weak-strong-weak-weak" is triple meter and
					"strong-weak-weak-weak" is a quadruple meter. Most popular music
					follow a 4/4 meter which is "strong-weak-medium-weak,
					strong-weak-medium-weak". Inter-onset interval a fancy term for the
					time between beats in music can be said to occur at various time spans
					ranging from 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds. The lower and upper
					inter-onset interval thresholds for events in a meter of 250
					milliseconds (about 240BPM) and 2 (about 30BPM) seconds respectively
					are strongly associated with the human sensorimotor systems. This
					range in music corresponds to a comfortable rate to which we can
					easily synchronise via body movements such as foot taps or hand claps.
					Popular music has a 500 millisecond interval which is about 120BPM
					which is quite close to our walking pace of ~600 milliseconds between
					steps (100BPM). Interval under 250 milliseconds feels to fast and
					frantic and is hard to follow with body movements. Interval above 2
					seconds lose the sense of a pulse and feels like trying to march to a
					grandfather clock. In groove based music rhythmic expressions occur at
					an extremely fine timescale, rapid enough to rule out auditory
					feedback mechanism for how the rhythmic expression is perceived. The
					question is how to explain our assimilation and production of very
					fast sequences of events in time given that human reflexes and neural
					transmission speeds are too slow to account for them. Think of the
					mistakes you make while typing fast. Your brain pre-plans the entire
					sequence rather than controlling each letter individually. Our brains
					group small actions into bigger units i.e. hierarchial organisation
					chunking fast actions into organised patterns. In groove based music
					rhythmic expressions involve micro timing deviations that occur in
					millisecond ranges lie subtle rushes, drags, swings, etc. that create
					the feel of music. These variations are often 10015 milliseconds in
					duration which is faster than what conscious perception can track.
					Auditory feedback mechanism requires time for:
					<br />
					-> sound production
					<br />
					-> sound transmission to the ear
					<br />
					-> neural processing of auditory information
					<br />
					-> motor system adjustment
					<br />
					-> implementation of corrective action
					<br />
					<br />
					This entire cycle takes 100-200ms, far too slow to control micro
					timing deviations that create groove so how do musicians create the
					groove? In most motor activities the auditory feedback serves as
					quality control system
					<br />
					-> monitoring output: "did i hit the right note?"
					<br />
					-> timing adjustment: "am i too slow or fast for the beat?"
					<br />
					-> volume control: "am i too loud or too soft?"
					<br />
					-> pitch correction: "am in tune?"
					<br />
					<br />
					The traditional motor control theory suggests the cycle:
					<br />
					-> plan an action (decide to play a note)
					<br />
					-> execute the action (muscles move)
					<br />
					-> monitor the result (hear what actually happened)
					<br />
					-> compare the intent (was it what i wanted?)
					<br />
					-> adjust the next action (correct if any errors)
					<br />
					<br />
					This works well for gross motor control and conscious adjustments but
					breaks down at fine timescales. At micro timing level (10-50ms) the
					groove variations happen faster than the feedback loop operates. By
					the time you could hear and correct a 20ms timing deviation multiple
					beats have already passed. So, instead of reactive feedback musicians
					use feed-forward control:
					<br />
					-> the brain creates models i.e. neural representations that predict
					the sensory consequences of motor actions
					<br />
					-> brain sends a signal to the muscles and keeps a copy of the motor
					command
					<br />
					-> brain predicts what should happen based on the command
					<br />
					-> sensory systems report what actually happened
					<br />
					-> brain compares predicted vs actual outcome
					<br />
					-> the forward model is adjusted to reduce future prediction errors
					<br />
					-> actions are based on this model and not reaction
					<br />
					<br />
					Through practice timing patterns become muscle memory. at the macro
					level the auditory feedback helps you stay with the overall beat &
					adjust major timing errors. At the micro level the subtle timing
					variations that create the feel of music must come from embodied
					predictive processes. Musicians must simultaneously:
					<br />
					-> let go of conscious control to allow micro variations
					<br />
					-> still maintain overall timing through the broader auditory feedback
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="italic">Pulse</span>: The presence of groove is music
					depends first and foremost on a strict pulse. A pulse is the steady
					"beat" that you feel throughout a piece of music like a musical
					heartbeat. These are regular recurring beats that create the
					foundation of the rhythm. Without a fundamental reference structure
					such as a steady pulse to guide a dancer's feet and musician's fingers
					there is probably no experience of a perceived rhythm or groove.
					Groove based music puts a great emphasis on avoiding tempo changes
					which are considered destructive to a good sense of groove. It has
					been theorised that humans posses internal biological oscillators that
					can synchronise with external rhythms that are present in the
					environment. Biological oscillators also known as endogenous
					oscillators, refer to the internal biological systems that generate
					rhythmic or periodic activities. Such oscillators are needed to
					maintain various physiological processes such as circadian rhythms,
					heart rate, and respiratory rate. These oscillators are present in all
					living organisms in some form or another. These oscillators are set
					into motion when exposed to external rhythms and generate self
					sustaining periodic activity that tunes into and synchronises with the
					pulse via a process called abstraction. These self sustaining
					oscillators are able to regularly adapt their period and phase to the
					changes in the external rhythms and hence are capable of dynamic
					entrainment rather than just simple synchronisation. Our brain makes
					this timing window called beat bin. When we hear music our brains do
					not expect every sound to hit atr the exact same millisecond, instead
					it has a beat bin. It is a small time window where sounds can still
					feel on the beat. It's like a basket around each beat and the sounds
					that land inside the basket feel on time and sounds that do not feel
					off time. Computer generated music where every instrument hits exactly
					at the same moment creates a narrow beat bin which can feel robotic. A
					live band where bass hits slightly before the drums and maybe guitar
					slightly after creates a wide beat bin to include all these sounds.
					Everything still feels on the beat but this has more richness to it
					and does not feel robotic. When instruments are slightly off sync our
					brains do not think this sounds bad. Instead, it adjusts its
					expectation and makes the timing window bigger so that all of the
					instruments can fit inside and still feel groovy.
