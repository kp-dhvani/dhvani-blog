					<p class="underline mb-2">A brief history of drums</p>
					<p>
						Drums play an important role in the rhythmic structure of every
						genre of music. From Kettle drums, Bass drums, Snare drums, etc. in
						the Western music to Tabla, Dhol, Mridangam, Dholak, etc. in the
						Indian music to the Persian Zerbaghali to Tanggu in China, drums
						have existed in all major civilisations in one form or the other for
						musical and non-musical purposes. First earliest evidence of drums
						comes from the idiophones (produce sound via the vibration of the
						entire instrument) made from mammoth bones found in present day
						Belgium dating back to 70,000BCE. The earliest archaeological
						evidence comes from China dating back to the Neolithic period around
						5500BCE where drums were made out of hollow wood logs and covered
						with alligator skin. There is evidence of drums around the same time
						in Mesopotamia where they played an important role in the religious
						affairs of the Sumerians. The first metal drum dates back to Bronze
						age in present day Vietnam. Drums can be seen in the sculptural
						artwork of Greece and Rome indicating the use of the instrument for
						cultural and military endeavours. The history of drums to Europe
						through Greece trace their roots to Danbara from ancient Persia
						imported with the name Tympanon. It was also know as Tympanum in the
						Roman culture. In Europe Tabor a portable snare drum played either
						with one hand or wit two drumsticks emerged as the prominent
						percussion instrument. The Renaissance witnessed further development
						in percussion particularly in military applications. In European
						armies drum became the instrument for issuing commands, coordinating
						movements, etc. The industrial revolution brought a new wave of
						changes in the drums with new materials such as metals and synthetic
						skins. William Ludwig's invention of base drum pedal in 1909
						revolutionised percussive performance. This paved the way for the
						development of the modern drum kit which became popular across
						various music genres such as Jazz, rock, etc.
