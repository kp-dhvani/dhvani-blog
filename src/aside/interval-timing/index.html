					One of the most fundamental variables that organisms have to quantify
					in order to survive is temporality or time. Our brains have to develop
					a sense of time to do activities like talk, sing, run, perform
					activities in a group, drive, etc. On a scale with microseconds on one
					side and circadian rhythm on the other temporal information guides our
					behaviour. A 12 order magnitude is covered by this scale.

				<p class="underline">Microsecond Scale</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Information processing in the microseconds is needed for binaural
					hearing and echolocation. For binaural hearing the microsecond scale
					is used by the auditory system to determine the differences in time in
					the action potentials for the two ears called as
					<span class="italic">interaural delay</span> to determine the spatial
					origin of the sound. The sound will arrive slightly earlier for the
					near ear usually in the order of 600-700&mu;s because of the natural
					interaural time difference (ITD).
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Milliseconds Range</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Intercal timing ranging from 200-1000ms involves a broad spectrum of
					activities ranging from collision avoidance, object interception,
					speech perception, motion processing, execution and processing music,
					coordinating fine movements, etc. The temporal processing in this
					range is quite sophisticated yet poorly understood on how the neural
					processing works to make it happen.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Seconds to Minute Scale</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Temporal processing in this range depends on conscious and cognitive
					control and is involved in foraging, decision making, sequential motor
					performance, arithmetic, associative learning, etc. Timing in this
					scale forms the contextual framework through which our behaviour is
					mapped onto the external world.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Circadian Rhythms</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					The biological timing that organises the daily environmental
					oscillations every 24 hours is known as the circadian clock. The two
					major functions of this clock are:
					<br />
					- Prepare your body for what's coming next based on the time of day.
					It optimises the temporal manifestations of different biological
					activities during the day by anticipating of recurring fluctuations in
					the environment.
					<br />
					- Prevent biological conflicts by timing different processes to not
					interfere with each other. Eg. release growth hormones only while
					sleeping and not during the day when you need energy for activities.
					<br />
					The circadian rhythm in mammals is governed by a complex network of
					<span class="italic">cellular molecular oscillators</span> distributed
					throughout the brain and peripheral tissues. The master clock is in
					the brain in this region known as
					<span class="italic">hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei</span> (SCN).
				</p>
				<div class="flex justify-center my-10">

				</div>
				<p class="mb-5">
					It synchronises the internal clock with the external light-dark cycle
					of the day. The internal circadian clock in mammals possesses a rhythm
					with an approximate 24 hour period and the synchronising signal is
					light. The SCN acts as a relay between the external light-dark cycle
					and the internal timing system. So, the peripheral clocks are governed
					directly by the SCN that controls the activities like feeding, body
					temperature, hormone release, etc.

				<p class="underline">
					Different timing mechanism for different timing behaviours?
				</p>
				<p>
					The word <span class="italic">timing</span> can have the connotation
					of either <span class="italic">how long</span> an event lasts or
					<span class="italic">when</span> an event occurs. So, the internal
					clocks should have the ability to encode the elapsed time from a
					stimulus or process such as the time between the notes in a song,
					along with the capacity to measure remaining time for an action where
					the system should select a precise moment for doing something for an
					accurate result like when a batsman hits a cricket ball.
					<br />
					Our brains need to compute time from different modalities of sensory
					stimulus or when involved in rhythmic activities like music and
					dancing or when marking the elapsed time from an event or as the time
					remaining for an action. So, some key elements of temporal processing
					include the time scale being quantified, the modality of the stimuli
					guiding the time perception, whether the time is being measured for a
					movement or perceptual decision, whether the task involves single or
					multiple intervals, whether the timing generated is external or
					internal.
