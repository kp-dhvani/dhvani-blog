					Why is typeof null an object in Javascript?

						All values in JS are either
						<span class="underline">primitives</span> or
						<span class="underline">objects</span>.
						<br />
						<br />
						Primitives
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-5">
						<li>Undefined</li>
						<li>Null</li>
						<li>Boolean</li>
						<li>Number</li>
						<li>String</li>
						<li>BigInt</li>
						<li>Symbol</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Primitives are immutable, you cannot add properties to them.
						<br />
						> var str = "xyz";
						<br />
						> str.foo = "abc"; // try to add property "foo"
						<br />
						> str.foo // no change undefined
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Primitives are compared by <span class="italic">value</span>, they
						are equal if they hold the same <span class="italic">value</span>
						<br />
						> "xyz" === "xyz";
						<br />
						true
					</p>
					<p>
						Objects: all non-primitive values are objects and they are mutable.
						<br />
						> var obj = {};
						<br />
						> obj.foo = "abc"; // add property "foo"
						<br />
						abc
						<br />
						> obj.foo // "foo" has been added
						<br />
						abc
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Objects are compared by <span class="italic">reference</span>. Two
						objects are considered equal only if they are in fact the same
						object.
						<br />
						> {} === {};
						<br />
						false
						<br />
						> var obj = {};
						<br />
						> obj === obj
						<br />
						true
					</p>

					<p class="mb-2">
						To find the type of a variable JS provides the operator
						<span class="italic">typeof</span> which returns a string indicating
						the type of the operand's value.
						<br />
						> console.log(typeof 10); // output: "number"
						<br />
						> console.log(typeof 'abc'); // output: "string"
						<br />
						> console.log(typeof false); // output: "boolean"
						<br />
						> console.log(typeof undeclaredVariable); // output: "undefined"
						<br />
					</p>
					<p>
						Ok so let's look at what happens when we check the typeof null
						<br />
						> console.log(typeof null); // output: "object"
					</p>
					<div class="flex justify-center my-10">
						<img
							src="/assets/wat.jpg"
							alt="wat meme"
							class="max-w-full h-auto md:w-1/2"
						/>
					</div>

						hhhmmm something doesn't look right, how can a primitive value have
						a type of non-primitive value? What kind of bug is this in JS? This
						quirky JS behaviour comes from its early implementation where the
						values were stored in 32 bit units and the type information was
						encoded using a bit level approach where the type value could be
						quickly computed by looking at the lower bits of a 32 bit memory
						unit. There were five of them:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-5">
						<li>000: data is reference to an object</li>
						<li>001: data is 31 bit signed integer</li>
						<li>010: data is reference to a floating point number</li>
						<li>100: data is a reference to string</li>
						<li>110: data is a boolean</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If the lowest bit (the rightmost bit) is 1 the tag is
						<span class="italic">1 bit long</span>. If the lowest bit is 0 the
						type tag is <span class="italic">3 bits long</span> which provides
						two additional bits for four types. Two values were special and
						differed in implementation:
						<span class="italic">undefined (JSVAL_VOID)</span> the integer
						<span class="italic">-2<sup>30</sup></span> which is
						<span class="italic">-1073741824</span> (a number outside the
						integer range) and <span class="italic">null (JSVAL_NULL)</span>
						<span class="underline"
							>the machine code NULL pointer or an object type tag plus a
							reference that is zero</span
						>. The system examined the type tag for null and rightfully said
						it's an "object". Remember JS was created as a prototype in 10 days
						by Brendan Eich so fore sighting such a bug was not really possible.
