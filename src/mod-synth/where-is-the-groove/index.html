					A couple of months ago I went to this "bush techno" gig in a hidden
					warehouse. To my surprise, my friends and I left in 30 minutes after
					reaching to the venue. The music was decent but no matter how much I
					tried I could not move my body to it and honestly I could not explain
					why moving my body to it was so hard. I am not a dancer and have only
					recently started to go out to gigs for dancing. I am a massive techno
					fan because so far in my experience of listening to different
					sounds/music genres techno and house are the only two genres to which
					I can move my body to. After attending a variety of events with
					different genres I realised I can't really move my body to anything
					else than house/techno. I still listen to a lot of other
					"non-dancable" genres but if I am going out for a dancing I only
					attend house/techno events. The only thing I could say about the music
					in the warehouse to my friends was
					<span class="italic">"It's not groovy"</span>. The whole experience
					made me think about groove and what exactly does it mean when someone
					says <span class="italic">"the music is groovy"</span>? Where does
					groove come from? Is there a way to measure groove in music? What
					makes something groovy and something else not so groovy? How does it
					differ from rhythm? Well let's dig in and see if we can find answers
					to these questions I have.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">What is groove?</p>
				<p>
					Humans have an inclination to move with music. Be it subtle foot taps
					and head nods or with full on dance moves we feel this urge to somehow
					sync to the music we are listening to. Steve Gadd one of the best
					known drummers in Jazz says about groove
				</p>
				<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
					<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
						I've found over the years that the feel overcomes everything. If you
						get a good groove happening, that carries it along. If it feels
						good, there's not a lot you have to do. You can pick and choose your
						spots to dynamically respond to what's going on, but you don't have
						to technically, constantly challenge yourself to fill in those
						spaces.

					How should we define the term <span class="italic">"groove"</span>?
					The word has been in the vocabulary of musicians in popular music for
					a number of decades but has only recently been introduced in the
					theoretical realm where it remains subjected to a variety of
					interpretations. Well let's try to get some theoretical definitions
					out of the way. Groove as a musical quality is an important part of
					genres like Jazz, Hip Hop, modern Pop and dance music. It is an aspect
					of the music that compels us to move and that this feeling is
					generally regarded as pleasurable. So we get some idea of what groove
					means here.
					<br />
					> Groove is often called the "feel of music".
					<br />
					> Groove can loosely be called "the feel of a rhythm".
					<br />
					> Groove is principally a property internal to music itself and arises
					from collected effects of various forms of musical nuances especially
					in regards to microtiming.
					<br />
					> In music theory groove refers to the rhythmic properties of pieces
					of music and/or the timing relationships of actions of individuals
					interacting with the music.
					<br />
					> From the musicians' perspective groove is commonly referred to a
					pleasing state in which the creation of music becomes seemingly
					effortless. When playing in a group the groove may be experienced when
					the interaction between the instruments becomes seamless and the music
					feels right subjectively. Or they could say that it is related to the
					rhythmic feel of a piece of music, how the individual parts or layers
					of the music interlock and interact with each other to create a
					unified rhythmic effect.
					<br />
					<br />
					Though the word groove has a long history in the field of music making
					its occurrence in the books on popular music theory is rare. The
					second edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz defines groove as
					"a persistently repeated pattern". Jeff Pressing a psychologist and
					music researcher says groove can be defined as a kinetic framework for
					reliable prediction of events and time pattern communication. Let's
					understand what that means here. Kinetic refers to the physical
					movement of motion. Groove transfers energy from musicians to
					listeners through predictable patterns that generate momentum.
					Perceptual and productive rivalries are established against a stable
					framework. What are rivalries here? It is a neurological phenomenon
					where competing ideas form in your brain for a sensory stimulus. It
					means that while a single stimuli is presented the perceived image or
					sound in this case will switch between two distinct perceptive ideas
					of what the stimulus is. An optical illusion is a good example of a
					visual rivalry. Ok what about perceptual rivalries? This means you
					hear the music in two different ways at once. One example is Queen's
					We Will Rock You song pattern: Stomp-Stomp-CLAP, Stomp-Stomp-CLAP. Is
					the clap the main beat or the stomps? So what's a productive rivalry?
					Also called Binocular rivalry, in this phenomenon the brain alternates
					between perceiving two different stimuli to each sensory organ even if
					those stimuli are not inherently conflicting. In music this means your
					head can move to one beat but your foot or hips can move to some other
					beat.
					<br />
					<br />
					Another definition comes from musicologist Richard Middleton who
					summarises groove as understanding of rhythmic patterning that
					underlines its role in producing the characteristic rhythmic feel of a
					piece, a feel created by repeated framework within which variation can
					then take place.
					<br />
					Ethnomusicologist Charles Keil who has gone so far to introduce a new
					branch of study called "groovology" based on this theory of
					"Participatory Discrepancies" or PDs. For him groove is a process
					rather than a thing, a verb than a noun. Keil acknowledges the
					traditional view that expressivity of music and its meaning is rooted
					in its musical syntax especially in the Western art music repertoire
					yet he claims that syntax does not explain the expressivity of many
					other forms of music performance around the world. His idea of
					expressivity of music includes substantial proportions of
					improvisation (eg. Jazz) and spontaneity, music that is a process and
					music that has groove i.e. music that motivates a motor response in
					listeners. In his book published together with Steven Feild
					<span class="italic">Music Grooves</span>, he says participatory
					discrepancies - deviations from precise metronomic timing
					relationships as a central source of groove. He says "everything has
					to be a bit out of time, a little out of pitch to groove" and is
					therefor the fundamentally imperfect result of a collaborative
					process. These subtle timing variations can include:
					<br />
					- Playing slightly ahead and/or behind the beat.
					<br />
					- Varying the duration of notes
					<br />
					- Shifting accents within rhythmic patterns.
					<br />
					- Creating micro timing differences between instruments.
					<br />
					These discrepancies aren't random but meaningful expressive choices
					that create tension and release. They are what makes music alive,
					rhythmic, and engaging rather than mechanically precise.
					<br />
					<br />
					Musicologist David Brackett combines a number of ideas to define
					groove. First, groove is a feature of the Western African musical
					tradition. Second, it is the result of a relaxed and flexible attitude
					to the underlying metronomic pulse. Third, that those definitions
					should suggest "too positivistic a formula". What he means by the
					third point is not to take the definitions as a complete scientific
					formula that fully explains a groove. Musical concepts like groove
					cannot be perfectly defined through objective and scientific analysis
					alone. He adds:
				</p>
				<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
					<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
						Discerning why some bands "groove" more than others is a complex
						affair. ... a groove exists because musicians know how to create one
						and audiences know how to respond to one. Something can only be
						recognised as a groove by a listener who has internalised the
						rhythmic syntax of a given musical idiom.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Musicologist Vijay Iyer provides a qualitative description of groove.
					In groove contexts musicians display a heightened microscopic
					senitivity to musical timing anf these musical quantities combine
					dynamically and holistically to form what some call a musician's feel.
					He says groove based music features a steady virtually isochronous
					pulse that is established collectively by an interlocking composite of
					rhythmic entities and is either intended for or derived from dance.
					That's a very technical definition of what a groove is so let's unpack
					it. He says for music to be groovy there has to be a consistent
					underlying beat that listeners can predict and follow, isochronous
					meaning equal time intervals between beats. The spacing has to be
					virtually (almost perfectly but not mechanical) regular. NO single
					instrument can create groove, it is a collective effort of various
					instruments to create the pulse with each instrument contributing to
					the overall rhythmic foundation. To be groovy each instrument has to
					play different rhythmic patterns on the main pulse and the distinct
					rhythms interlock together like puzzle pieces. Thin of it like this:
					kick drum on beats 1 and 3 (strong beats), snare on beats 2 and 4
					(backbeats), bass with a complex pattern using 8<sup>th</sup> or
					16<sup>th</sup> notes, and hi hats on steady 8<sup>th</sup> or 16<sup
						>th</sup
					>
					notes. Each sound occupies different rhythmic spaces.
					<br />
					The groove then gives rise to the perception of steady pulse in a
					musical performance and it engages the "walk" (locomotor) channel of
					the listener's sensorimotor system giving rise to entrainment.
					Entrainment is when your body's internal rhythm synchronizes with an
					external rhythmic stimulus. So, basically when you automatically lock
					in with the music because the music is so groovy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ok so that's a lot of theoretical definitions for groove and that is
					one way to define groove. Groove as an inherent property of music and
					something that exists in the music itself and is characterised by a
					steady pulse, micro timing deviations, participatory discrepancies,
					interlocking rhythmic patterns, etc. which we call the "feel of the
					music". Music has a groove, the feeling which accompanies after
					perceiving the sound of music is a by product of our apprehension of
					music's groove through our bodies.
					<br />
					But what happens when I listen to something that has all of the
					aforementioned characteristics and still not be able to move my body
					to it and be able to dance to it? One one account groove is the feel
					of the music and on the other groove is the psychological feeling
					which is induced by music of wanting to move one's body. The first
					account can be termed as
					<span class="italic">"groove as feel"</span> and the other can be
					termed as <span class="italic">"groove as movement"</span>.
					<br />
					Both concepts involve rhythm and body but groove as a feel is more of
					a technical craft. For instance if two drummers play the exact same
					beat but one hits the snare 20 millisecond behind the beat (laid-back
					feel) vs exactly on time. Think of a chef using their knife skill to
					perfectly cut a piece of meat - the technique of how they cut not
					whether the cooked meat tastes good.
					<br />
					<br />
					In case of groove as a movement it can be roughly defined as the
					feeling generated by music that induces bodily movement and centering
					the psychological inquiry on the movement inducing feature of groove
					is well supported. Pter Janata a neuroscientist has conducted an
					excellent study understanding how various characteristics of groove
					are perceived by listeners among other things. The participants were
					asked to agree or disagree (strongly or otherwise) with a number of
					claims about groove and the claim that "groove depends on the extent
					to which the music makes you want to move" is the most strongly agreed
					aspect of groove for the participants. Below is is the complete survey
					response.
