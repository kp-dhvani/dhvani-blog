						Sound: The fabric of our reality?

					<p class="text-center mb-2">Auṃ ॐ</p>

						As per the Hindu cosmogony, this primordial sound is what the
						supreme deity Brahmā who emerged from a lotus from the navel of lord
						Viṣṇu (विष्णु) uttered which generated the five great elements
						Pañcamahābhūta (पञ्चमहाभूत) :
					</p>
					<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Ākāśa (आकाश): Ether/Space first element formed from the vibration
							of Aum.
						</li>
						<li>Vāyu (वायु): Air from ether's motion</li>
						<li>Agni (अग्नि): Fire from air's friction</li>
						<li>Jala (जल): Water when fire condenses</li>
						<li>Pṛthvī (पृथ्वी): Earth when water solidifies</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						The universe emerges from nāda (नाद) the primordial sound. Nāda
						Brahmā (नाद ब्रह्मा) i.e. the sound of creation is considered the
						foundation of existence.

						Bhartṛhari (भर्तृहरि) was a Hindu linguistic, philosopher, and a
						poet circa 5<sup>th</sup> century
						<abbr title="common era">CE</abbr>. He is best know for his work
						Vākyapadīya (वाक्यपदीय) which is treatise on sentences and words. In

						In Christian worships practices, believers connect to the divine
						through hymns, psalms, and chants. Gregorian chant was foundational
						to early Western music influencing the development of polyphony,
						musical notation, sacred compositional traditions, etc.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						The act of creation in Judaism too is linked to speech. Jewish
						tradition teaches that the world was created through ten divine
						utterances. The utterances from Genesis include "Let there be light"
						and other statements from God. The blowing of <em>shofar</em> a
						trumpet made from the horn of a kosher animal with the marrow
						removed during Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) and at the
						conclusion of Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) shows the significant
						role played by sound in Jewish rituals.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						In Islam, the Quran describes the act of creation as. being
						initiated by the divine command <em>Kun</em> which means "Be". The
						full phrase is "Kun Fayakun" meaning "be, and it is". Appearing 8
						times in the Quran, it symbolises the instantaneous nature of divine
						creation: when Allah wills something to exist, it exists
						immediately.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						In Sikhism, <em>Shabad</em> (Divine Word) and <em>Naam</em> (Divine
						Name) are central to the creation of this world.
						<em>Hukum</em> (Divine Command/Will/Order) governs the creation.
						<em>Guru Granth Sahib</em> the holy scripture of Sikhism talks about
						the practice of <em>Kirtan</em>, the singing of hymns as a a form of
						devotion to foster a deep connection with the Creator.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Several Native American cultures believe that songs and sounds are
						not just tools for communication but are sacred and shape the world.
						The Hopi people identifies the role of singing in their cosmology
						where the <em>Creator Taiowa</em> first conceived the world and
						<em>Sotuknang</em> his nephew executed the creation through the
						power of sound and song. The Lakota people have ceremonies like the
						<em>Sun Dance</em> or the use of the <em>Sacred Pipe</em> with
						scared songs that are believed to sustain the cosmic order. The
						songs are believed to be "language of the spirits", allowing for a
						direct connection with the divine. For the Navajo people the
						<em>Holy Wind (Níłch’i)</em> is the source of all movement, breath
						and speech. Chanting in ceremonies is designed to re-align the
						individual with the Holy Wind to restore beauty.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						In many African cultures drumming sounds, chanting and singing plays
						a big role in spiritual practice. The Dogon people of Mali of West
						Africa believe that Creator <em>Amma</em>, began the universe with
						vibrations and is often compared to the weaving process where sound
						and vibration are the threads that create the fabric of reality.
						These vibrations are symbolised by drums which is a sacred
						instrument that plays the rhythms of creation. The Yoruba people use
						<em>Oriki</em>, praise poetry to call forth the spiritual power of
						the ancestors into their physical realm. It is believed to carry the
						power of creation as it invokes the energy of the
						<em>Orishas</em> (deities). Across many African cultures, the drum
						is a scared instrument that bridges humanity to divine. the
						<em>Djembe Drum</em> is believed to carry the heartbeat of earth.
						The drumbeat is associated with the pulse of life.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						In Chinese philosophy, <em>Daoism (Taoism)</em> and the concept of
						<em>Dao (Tao)</em> are tied to sound and vibration which is the
						ultimate principle that governs the universe. Sound and vibration
						are seen as manifestations of the Dao's flow and harmony. Japanese
						<em>Shinto</em> and Buddhist traditions too reflect the belief in
						the power of vibration and resonance. In Shinto
						<em>Kotodama</em> "the spirit of words" empahsises that spoken words
						carry spiritual power.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Ancient Egyptians and Greek had similar outlook of sound being the
						force in the creation of this universe. As per the Egyptian
						<em>Memphis creation myth</em>, the creation is attributed to
						<em>Ptah</em> which was not a physical but an intellectual creation
						by the Word and the Mind of the God. Ptah's creative thought and
						speech were believed to have caused the formation of <em>Atum</em>,
						the primordial God from whom all arose and <em>Ennead</em> a group
						of 9 deities including Atum. The Greeks believed that the universe
						was governed by an intrinsic order often described as
						<em>Kosmos</em> which was reflected in music, mathematics, and the
						natural world. Spoken word held an utmost importance in the Greek
						mythology. As seen by the myths of <em>Orpheus</em>, the legendary
						musician and poet who could charm animals and even influence gods
						with this powerful songs and words.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						I hope you get where I am going with these examples and analogies
						with respect to sound and our quest to make sense of our reality and
						the creation of this universe. Humans are phenotypic creatures, we
						focus on the manifested form in the sense of what we see - more than
						what we hear. Audition is secondary while sight is primary. Shifting
						our attention to sound reveals it as the primary medium through
						which we have historically deciphered reality. To speak is not
						merely to label, but to instantiate - to execute a universe through
						the power of utterance. Language therefore, is not just a tool for
						communication it is the very architecture of the human experience.

						Introduction: Phonology, the study of sound patterns in language
					</h2>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Language is a structured system of communication consisting of
						grammar and vocabulary. Language forms the primary means by which
						humans convey meaning in spoken, signed, and written forms. There
						are various theories around how language evolved but the truth is we
						do not know; all theories are just speculation. But that doesn't
						stop us from not studying this phenomena and trying to understand
						its intricacies. The study of language is called linguistics. But
						since language is such a complex phenomena, linguistic is not
						confined to study just one aspect of language. The areas of
						linguistic analysis are syntax (rules governing the structure of
						sentences), semantics (meaning), morphology (structure of words),
						phonetics (production of speech sounds), phonology (the topic of
						this section), and pragmatics (how the context of use contributes to
						meaning).
					</p>
					<p>
						Language begins with sound, when most of us think of language we
						think of speaking. If there is no sound there is no language
						(exception being sign language). Phonology is the study of the
						categorical organisation of speech sounds in languages. It studies
						how sounds are organised in the mind and used to convey meaning.
						Then there's phonetics not to be confused with phonology. Phonology
						studies the abstract ideas of sound and how we use those sounds to
						communicate whereas phonetics is concerned with the physical act and
						properties of sound. We make variety of sounds using lips, tongue,
						mouth and some bits of our throat. If you want to make let's say a
						[b] sound, you close your lips first and then open it and release
						the air all at once. Phonetics deals with how we make this sound,
						how we hear it, how we can describe it deal with them empirically,
						and how we can make it visible to its practical to write it down and
						print.

					</figure>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Phonology investigates how sounds are organised in a particular
						language and how these sounds follow rules and a predictable
						pattern. These investigations are also focused on how the sounds are
						stored and processed in the brain and what's their function in
						conveying meaning in the linguistic contexts. Phonology forms an
						interesting part of social reality as phonological patterns - how
						individuals use sound patterns - can indicate a lot about them,
						examples being their social class, regional background, educational
						background, ethnicity, personal identity, etc. A subfield of
						phonology, called <em>sociophonetics</em> intersects
						<em>sociolinguistics</em> explores how variations in phonological
						patterns correlate with social factors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Phonology also affects language acquisition. Babies start to tune to
						their native languages quite early and are quite proficient at
						recognising and producing phonological patterns which is crucial for
						the development of grammar and vocabulary. Phonology from a
						cognitive perspective explains the mental processes involved in
						speech production and perception. The words stored in the brain are
						not just organised by semantics but also by phonological structures
						and this organisation affects how we retrieve and process words.
						Native speakers of tonal languages like Mandarin, Cantonese, and
						Vietnamese are more likely to have a precise and stable form of
						absolute pitch perception and reproduction.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Studying phonology offers a window into our minds, language and
						society. It shows that sound systems are not merely abstract
						entities but deeply connected to our social identities, cognitive
						processes, and our inquiries into the human mind.
					</p>
					<h3 class="mb-2 text-sm underline">Phonemes</h3>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Phoneme is the fundamental unit in phonology. A phoneme is a
						smallest unit of sound that can change the meaning of a word. In
						English for example, the sounds /b/ and /m/ are distinct phonemes
						because they distinguish meanings of the words like "bat" and "mat".
						Phonemes are <em>abstract</em> unit of sounds and represent a group
						of related sounds that speakers of a language perceive as identical.
						There are slight variations in how those sounds in a group are
						pronounced based on context and these variations are called
						<em>allophones</em>. For example the sound [p] in words "pot" and
						"spot". When you say pot you leave some air out of your mouth
						(called aspiration) after making the [p] sound but when saying spot
						there's no aspiration.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Note: You'll see me using two notations to describe phonemes. The
						notation /p/ is the phoneme as it exists in the brain as a category.
						The notation [p] is the <em>phone</em> the actual physical sound
						coming out of our mouths. Even though they are same
						<em>phonemes</em> /p/ there are two different <em>phones</em> [p]
						(without an aspiration) and [p<sup>h</sup>] (with an aspiration). Do
						not pronounce these sounds as alphabets like Pee or Bee but more
						like Pa or Ba.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Now that we have covered some basics of phonology, let's understand
						what are the sounds we need to make in order to speak a language
						like Sanskrit.

						Indo-European: The mother tongue of Sanskrit
					</h2>
					<p class="mb-2">
						We all carry the past around with us all the time. We have inherited
						our physical features - eyes, face, lips, hair, and nose - alongside
						deeper biological predispositions from food sensitivities and
						allergies to our neurological response to fear and anxiety. In
						genetics, these are our heritable traits; we are the living
						manifestation of our ancestors' biological history. It's a physical
						blueprint passed down from people we've never met. I hardly know
						anything about my great-grandparents let alone their names. If you
						think about it, it's quite unsettling that we do not much about our
						ancestors from the past who have given us so many of our traits.
					</p>
					<p>
						Archaeology is our best hope and way to acknowledge the humanity and
						importance of the people who lived before us. It is our best effort
						to investigate the past lives not described in writing which
						constitutes majority of human history. Humans have spent 95% of
						their time as hunter gatherers, we are biologically and
						phonologically calibrated for a world we no longer live in. We have
						absolutely no clue of how our hunter gatherer ancestors spoke and
						communicated. Sounds do not fossilise, we cannot know the specific
						vocabulary or grammar of hunter gatherers from 50,000 or 100,000
						years ago. However, that does not stop us from searching for the
						language that our recent ancestors spoke. Many linguists believe
						that language we use today is the medium to know the lives of our
						ancient speakers. It contains fossils of of their lives and
						environment which we can decode. If we can reover their vocabulary
						through the words we use today we can get an insight into the
						everyday lives of the communities that lived in the past. In fact, a
						substantial vocabulary list has been reconstructed for one of the
						languages spoken about five thousand years ago and is the ancestor
						of modern languages like English, French, Spanish, German, Hindi,
						Marathi, Punjabi, Nepali, Bengali, Persian, Italian, Russian,
						Polish, Latvian, Irish, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, etc. to classical
						languages like Latin, Avestan, and Sanskrit, ancient Greek to
						ancient languages like Anatolian, Tocharian. All the languages shown

						Today these languages are spoken by more than 3 billion people. The
						origin of people who spoke this mother tongue has been a topic of
						fierce debate since about two hundred years now and has evolved into
						a cultural and racial war ever since the idea was hypothesised. From

					<p>
						In 1771, Sir William Jones a Welsh philologist published his book
						<em>Grammar of the Persian Language</em> and was the first English
						guide to understanding the Persians. This book at the age of 25
						earned him a reputation as one of the most respected linguists in
						Europe. His translations of Persian poems inspired many European
						Romantic philosophers. He was appointed as one of the three justices
						of rhe first Supreme Court of Bengal in Calcutta. He was to regulate
						both the English merchants and the rights and duties of Indians as
						the colonial subjects in the British Raj. The issue he faced soon
						after arriving was that although the English merchants recognised
						his legal authority, the Indians obeyed an already functioning and
						ancient system of Hindu law which was regularly cited in the court
						by the Hindu legal scholars called <em>pandits</em>. The English
						judges had no idea if these laws actually existed since most of the
						legal texts were in Sanskrit a language foreign to the judges. Jones
						started to read the texts and made comparisons not just with Persian
						and English but also Latin and Greek which he had learnt in
						university, with Gothic a literary form of German which he had also
						learnt and with Welsh his native tongue. On February 2 1786 he made
						the following announcement in the
						<em>Asiatic Society of Bengal</em> which he had founded when he had
						arrived to India:

							bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of
							verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been
							produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could

						While ancient civilisations have studied grammar, the 19<sup
							>th</sup
						>
						century marked the birth of <em>Comparative Philology</em> which was
						the precursor to the modern linguistics. When the idea of
						Indo-European as a language group was introduced we only knew how to
						define the language family and how to determine which languages
						belonged to the family. The discipline of linguistics and the early
						analytical methods invented by the 19<sup>th</sup> century
						philologists are still used today to describe, classify, and explain
						language variations across the world. Historical linguists provided
						us with this ability to reconstruct parts of extinct languages for
						which no written evidence survives today. This is possible by
						relying on the regularities in the way sounds change in our mouths.
						Let's say if you collect the Indo-European word for hundred from the
						different branches of the language family and jot down the pattern
						of sound change in all of those words you can reconstruct a single
						hypothetical ancestral word as the root for that word in all of the
						branches. The Latin word for hundred <em>kentum</em> and the
						Sanskrit word <em>śatam</em> are cognates of the ancestral root word
						<em><sup>*</sup>ḱm̥tóm-</em> (The asterisk * is a "orthographic
						signal" in linguistics. It tells the reader: "This word is never
						found in writing; it is a mathematical reconstruction"). This is a
						<em>hypothetical</em> root for the word hundred in
						<em>Proto-Indo-European</em> (PIE) mother tongue. It's a statistical
						average rather than a spoken word. We don't know how the word was
						pronounced as sounds don't leave any fossils, we can't hear the
						past. Linguists have reconstructed the sounds of more than 1500
						Proto-Indo-European roots. So how do we know that they are accurate?
						Well we can't but on the other hand, archaeological excavations have
						revealed inscriptions in Hittite, Mycenaean, Greek, and archaic
						German that contained words, never seen before showing the precisely
						the sounds previously reconstructed by comparative linguists. This
						sort of gives credibility to the linguists and their reconstructed
						roots. <em>Linear B</em> was a syllabic script that was used for
						writing in Mycenaean Greek which is the earliest attested form of
						the Greek language. When Linear B was deciphered in 1952, it
						revealed a form of Greek much older than Homer. It contained a "kw"
						sound that linguists had reconstructed years earlier but had never
						actually seen in later Greek texts.

					<p class="mb-5">
						So, yes that the reconstructed roots and words are not real but at
						least they can be considered a close approximation and that gives a
						framework to work on the comparative study of the language family.
						The reconstructed lexicon is a window into the environment, social
						life, and beliefs of the speakers of Proto-Indo-European. The
						lexicon reconstructions show that they had words for cattle (cow,
						ox), otter, beaver, wolf, lynx, elk, horse, mouse, hedgehog, goose,
						duck, eagle, bee, honey, sheep, pig, dog, etc. The lexical evidence
						can be attested and compared against archaeological remains to
						reconstruct the environment, economy, and ecology of the speakers.
						So, how do linguists reconstruct such languages that we have never
						heard or seen in a written form?

						Phonological change: How to reconstruct a dead language
					</h2>
					<p>
						Most of the languages in the Proto-Indo-European language family can
						be divided into 2 categories based on how the the languages
						represent the number 100: <em>Centum</em> and <em>Satem</em>. Centum
						comes from Latin and is pronounced as Kentum. Latin C is pronounced
						as K and this is a bit confusing for people learning Latin languages
						Like French and Spanish. In fact it also confuses people learning
						English since English uses Latin script. Satem comes from Avestan
						which is the holy language of Zoroastrians. Avestan and Sanskrit are
						daughters languages and share a lot of similarities among them. But
						why create such a category based on how these daughter languages
						represent the number 100? The answer is the sound difference. This
						division is based on how the Indo-European languages treat the sound
						coming from the back of the throat, also called as
						<em>velar</em> which is the soft palate at the back of the mouth and
						include phonemes like [k], [g], etc. The satem languages are the
						eastern division of the language family geographically speaking and
						include languages like Indo-Iranian, Armenian, Albanian, and
						Balto-Slavic. The centum languages are in the western group and
						include Greek, Italic, Germanic, and Celtic. These two words are
						<em>cognates</em> as they both mean "100". However, much like any
						other category of taxonomy we come up with there are always
						exceptions. Tocharian (now extinct) an Indo-European language from
						modern day northwest of China in Xinjiang is part of the centum
						family. The word for 100 in two of the dialects of the language was
						<em>känt</em> (Tocharian A) and <em>kante</em> (Tocharian B). So,
						this division is merely academic and does not actually show a clear
						geographic divide within the Indo-European language family.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Before we dive into how linguists reconstruct a dead language let's
						clear up some terminologies and concepts used in linguistic.

						<em>Stops, Fricatives, and Affricates</em> respectively. In
						phonetics, <em>consonants</em> are classified by how the airflow is
						obstructed through the vocal tract which is called the manner of
						articulation. Articulation is how we shape or obstruct the air flow
						from our lungs as it leaves our body to create different sounds.
						<em
							>If the airflow is completely blocked and then released we get a
							stop which is also called a plosive. If the airflow is partially
							obstructed creating friction we get a fricative. If you combine
							the two - block first, then release into friction - we get an
							affricate.</em
						>
						Some examples of each in English:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>Stops: [p], [b], [t], [d], [k], [g]</li>
						<li>Fricatives: [f], [v], [th] or [&theta;], [s], [z]</li>
						<li>Affricates: [t&#643;] 'ch' in chat, [d&#658;] 'j' in judge</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The character &#643; is called <em>Esh</em> and it represents
						fricative, eg. 'sh' in ship.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						The character &#658; is called <em>Ezh</em> and is the
						<em>voiced</em> twin of Esh, meaning your vocal chords vibrate when
						you say the j in judge.
					</p>
					<p>
						The phonemic system of
						<abbr title="Indo European">IE</abbr> contained
						<em>vowels, semivowels, and consonants</em>. The
						<abbr title="Indo European">IE</abbr> consonant system consisted
						mostly stops.

					<p class="mb-2">
						The Latin word for 100 is Centum (pronounced Kentum) and sometime in
						early Medieval French there was a dialectical version of this word
						which was <em>tsent'm</em>. The sound change that has occurred here
						is called <em>palatalisation</em>. In instances where c (k) a
						<em>velar</em> sound was preceded by a front vowel - vowels produced
						when the tongue is positioned towards the front of the mouth like i
						and e - went through a softening process and turned into a dental
						affricate [ts]. By the time modern French evolved the [ts] sound was
						simplified further and turned into a sibilant [s], so the word for
						100 in French is <em>cent</em> (pronounced with s). Latin
						<em>cera</em> [kera] 'wax' became French <em>cire</em> pronounced
						<em>seer</em> and Latin <em>civitas</em> [kivitas] 'community'
						became French <em>cité</em> pronounced <em>seetay</em>. These sound
						changes were not random and confined to certain words, they spread
						systematically to all similar sounds in the language. In instances
						where Latin <em>k-</em> was followed by back vowel (-o) it remained
						a <em>k-</em>. For example, Latin <em>costa</em> 'rib' is French
						<em>côte</em>.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Human language is governed by rules and they determine the sentence
						construction (syntax), the relationship between sounds of words
						(phonology and morphology), and their meaning. The direction of
						sound changes are governed by two constraints: ones that are
						generally applicable across most of the languages, and those
						specific to a single language. The general constraints are imposed
						by the biological and mechanical limits of the human vocal anatomy.
						Constraints within a language are imposed by the limited range of
						sounds that are acceptable and meaningful for that language. Using
						this piece of knowledge linguistics can determined which phonetic
						variants came first and which ones came later. But how do they make
						these decisions?
					</p>
					<p>
						Two general rules help figure out the order. One is that initial
						hard consonants like
						<em>k</em> and <em>g</em> tend to move towards soft sounds like
						<em>s</em> and <em>sh</em> if they change at all but a change from
						<em>s</em> to <em>k</em> would be quite unusual. Another one is that
						a consonant pronounced as a stop in the back of the mouth
						<em>k</em> is more likely to shift toward the front of the mouth
						<em>t or s</em> in a word where it is followed by a vowel that is
						pronounced in the front of the mouth. This phenomena is termed as
						<em>assimilation</em>: one sound tends to assimilate to a nearby
						sound in the same word, simplifying the movements needed to say the
						word. The specific type of assimilation of <em>k</em> to
						<em>s</em> is called palatalisation. In fact, palatalisation has
						been a key factor in development of French from Latin and is
						responsible for much of the unique phonology of the French language.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Assimilation usually changes the quality of a sound and sometimes
						removes sounds by combining two sounds together. The opposite of
						assimilation is the addition of new sounds to a word. Many native
						English speakers insert [-uh] when they say <em>athlete</em>.
						Instead of two syllables <em>Ath-Leet</em> it turns into three:
						<em>Ath-uh-Leet</em> and introduces a schwa sound <em>uh</em>. The
						schwa sound is also known as the lazy sound.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						The two phenomenon explained above are called phonological and
						analogical changes and are the mechanisms through which new forms
						are incorporated in a language. Linguists examine several different
						points in the past - inscriptions in say classical Lati, vulgar
						Latin, early Medieval French, later Medieval French and modern
						French - to map the all the phonological and analogical shifts in
						the evolution of French from Latin. Let's now understand how the
						word for 100 was reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first thing linguists did was that they gathered up all the
						daughter words of the Indo-European language family in a list. Here,
						knowing the rules for the sound change is of utmost importance as
						some sounds can change radically. Let's take hundred as a reference.

							Table 1.2: Indo-European Cognates for the Root "Hundred"
						</p>
					</div>
					<p class="mb-2">
						The linguists asks: are these words phonetically transformed
						daughters of the a single parent word? If yes, they are cognates.
						Also, to prove they are cognates they need to be able to reconstruct
						the sequence of phonemes that could have developed into all the
						documented daughter sounds through the known rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's look at the first word. We have 3 variations in the sounds:
						[k], [h], [s]. The [k] in Latin can be explained if the parent
						<abbr title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</abbr> term began with a [k]
						sound as well. But what about Avestan, Old Indic, and Lithuanian
						[s]. Remember hard consonant sounds tend to soften through
						palatalisation so if the parent
						<abbr title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</abbr> began with a [k] then
						it is quite plausible that these language groups went through a
						sound change and turned to a sibilant [s]. Well why can't we argue
						that the sound shift happened from [s] to [k] and that
						<abbr title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</abbr> had [s] as the first
						sound? Going from a sibilant fricative (s) to a velar stop (k) is
						rare for several physical reasons:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>
							Complexity: A [k] sound requires a total blockage of airflow at
							the back of the mouth (the velum), followed by a sudden release of
							air. A [s] sound is a continuous stream of air pushed through a
							narrow gap.
						</li>
						<li>
							Energy expenditure: Stops like [k] and [g] require more muscular
							tension in the tension and throat. We tend to naturally gravitate
							towards path of least resistance which is why [k] often softens
							into [s] or [sh].
						</li>
						<li>
							Articulation: Sounds usually move forward in the mouth
							(palatalisation). Moving a sound from front to back is unnatural
							for the tongue in rapid speech.
						</li>

					<p>
						So we can add more weightage to the possibility that [k] was the
						first sound in the parent
						<abbr title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</abbr> word but what about the
						[h] in Gothic, Old Saxon, Old English, etc.? These daughter
						languages are in the category of Germanic languages, English is a
