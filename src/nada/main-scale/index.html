						These notes from the classical texts but are also referred to by
						their corresponding solfege syllables, the entire group being called
						सप्तक (Saptak). <sup>*</sup>Sapt = 7 [Solfege is a system used to
						teach pitch and sight-singing in music. It assigns specific
						syllables to each note of a scale, which helps musicians to learn
						and recognize pitches, intervals, and melodies. Solfege is widely
						used in music education, especially for vocal training, and is a
						foundational tool for understanding melody and harmony.]
						<br />
						The eighth note is a repetition of the first thus making an octave
						between the two with a ratio of 1:2 and forming a consonance. In
						this manner it corresponds to the Western scale.

					<p>
						You'll see that between the Sa-Re, Re-Ga, Ma-Pa, Pa-Dha, and Dha-Ni
						there is another key that lies in between each pair but notes Ga-Ma
						and Ni-Sᵒa. The former notes are a whole step (tone) apart while the
						latter are semi-tone apart. The former is called the शुद्ध स्वर
						(Shuddha Swar) i.e. pure, natural notes. The intermediary notes in
						the series Sa-Re, Re-Ga, Ma-Pa, Pa-Dha, and Dha-Ni can be denoted as
						<span class="underline">Ra</span>,
						<span class="underline">Ga</span>, Mâ,
						<span class="underline">Pa</span>,
						<span class="underline">Dha</span>, and
						<span class="underline">Ni</span>. are called विकृत स्वर (Vikrit
						Swar) or altered notes. There is however no notes between Ga-Ma and
						Ni-Sa as these notes are musically too close to allow any
						interpolation and would be difficult to make out any स्वर (Swar)
						between them.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p class="mb-5">
						<span class="underline"
							>So far we have come across the terms नाद (Nāda), स्वर (Swar), and
							श्रुति (Śruti) to refer to the musical sounds but what makes them
							different from each other and where do these terms fit in the
							musical scale?</span
						>
						<br />
					</p>
					स्वर carries 2 different meanings.
					<ol class="pl-5 list-disc">
						<li>
							स्वर in Saptak (octave): There are the 12 different (7 Shuddha and
							5 Vikrit) types of musical notes identifiable by the ears in a
							Saptak. However 10 of these notes excluding Shadja (the tonic) and
							Pancham (the third harmonic) actually have a range of or a group
							of individual frequencies which are all identified as the same
							Swar (note). This range should actually be called स्वरक्षेत्र
							(Swarakshetra). [needs more info on this...]
						</li>
						<li>
							स्वर in Rāga: These are the precise single frequencies within a
							Swarakshetra which make the scale of the Rāga. [more on Rāga in
							later articles]
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						There are innumerable musical sounds as individual frequencies
						called Nāda within 2 Shadja (i.e. an octave or Saptak). In order to
						create Hindustani music (i.e. Rāga) we must be able to "stay" on
						some of them. These selected Nāda to be used to stay on are called
						Śruti and there 22 of them [more on why they are 22 will be in late
						articles]. Out of these 22 the ones selected for Rāga becomes Swar
						of that Rāga. Thus,
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-5">
						<li>All individual frequencies between 2 Shadja are Nāda</li>
						<li>Those Nāda selected to stay on in Rāga become Śruti</li>
						<li>The selcted Śrutis in a Rāga are Swar.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<p>
						Śruti comes from an old Sanskrit saying
						<span class="italic">श्रु्यते इति श्रुति</span> (śrūyate iti śruti)
						which means when a Nāda is heard so clearly that it can be
						'identified' as it is called a śruti. This is possible only when we
						stay on a Nāda which allows our ears to recognise it as a musical
						note. So to summarise: All the players in Cricket are Nāda, the 22
						selcted are Śruti and the ones playing are for a particular match
						are Swar.
					</p>
					<p class="underline">
						Question: why do we stay on only the 22 Śruti? is it due to their
						relationship with Shadja? (research this)
