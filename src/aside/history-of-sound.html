						<span class="italic">Velocity</span>, the unit used to measure the
						speed of sound through a medium comes from Latin
						<span class="italic">celeritas</span> (root
						<span class="italic">celer</span> meaning quick or swift). You see
						<span class="italic">c</span> as universal symbol for speed of light
						but V was the most common symbol used in the 19th century started by
						Maxwell in 1865. Actual history is a bit ambiguous on why is c the
						symbol of light so it stands for either "constant" or "celeritas".

						Sound being a vibrational phenomenon was known as early as 6<sup
							>th</sup
						>
						BC, the Greek mathematician Pythagoras was aware that sound is
						vibration. We also have written records from the Greek philosopher
						Aristotle (350 BC) with rudimentary knowledge of sound propagation.
						He also believed that high frequencies traveled faster through air
						than low frequencies.
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
						“All sounds are produced because air is set in motion by expansion
						or compression or when it is clashed together by an impact from the
						breath or from the strings of musical instruments”
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mb-10">
						The first explicit mention of sound comes from Francis Bacon where
						he discussed the possibility of comparing the speed of sound to that
						of the light by calculating the time taken by a church bell sound to
						travel a mile. He compared this value with a simultaneous light
						signal over the same distance using his own pulse as the timing
						mechanism. But the first quantitative value came from Marin Mersènne
						a French mathematician, natural philosopher, and catholic priest (a
						highly influential figure in the development of acoustic science)
						who in 1640 recorded the speed of sound as it travels through air.
						He used musical instruments and gun sounds and estimated the
						distance traveled in one second to be
						<span class="italic">230 French Toises</span> which is
						<span class="font-bold">448m/s</span> which has an error of around
						10%. He used a pendulum to measure the time between the flash of
						exploding gunpowder and the arrival of the sound. Although it might
						seem like a large error it is still quite impressive given the
						technology during his time. He also, incorrectly asserted that the
						same speed is observed at day and night, either with wind or against
						it. Pierre Gassandi a French philosopher, Catholic priest,
						astronomer, and mathematician used a mechanical timepiece to measure
						the time between the flash of exploding gunpowder and the arrival of
						the sound. He discovered that all pitches travel at the same speed
						but he incorrectly concluded as that of Mersènne that wind has no
						effect on the velocity. This was when importance of air as a medium
						for sound was still not realised but the Italian physicist and
						mathematician Evangelista Torricelli's invention of the
						<span class="italic">braometer</span> helped others conduct their
						experiments in air pumps. In the 17th century Sir Issac Newton
						showed that in an elastic fluid the sound speed propagation is
						proportional to the square root of elasticity divided by density.
						The reasoning for which is unclear and mathematicians Lagrange
						actually claimed the derivation to be illogical. Newton then used
						Boyle's law which is true only for constant temperature to derive
						the speed as <span class="italic">c = √p/e</span> which comes to
						<span class="italic">295m/s</span>. He concluded that the
						experimental data then available shows velocity lies between
						<span class="italic">290-330 m/s</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						Several experiments for the speed of sound were conducted in this
						time. Reverend William Derham in 1708, fired guns from various
						church towers, covering a distance of 20.1 km and used a pendulum
						beating every half second for timing the arrival of the report of
						the sound and arrived at a mean value of
						<span class="italic">348m/s</span>. With his series of tests
						conducted he was able to show that favourable winds accelerated
						sound propagation while opposing winds retarded it. Unfortunately,
						he used a fifteen point scale and translating that to true wind
						speed has not been done. These experiments were been conducted while
						thermometry was still new. Celsius scale was first proposed in 1742.
						While Derham did not measure the temperature he incorrectly
						concluded that wind speed was same in summer and winter both.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						In 1738, the Académie des Sciences organised experiments to measure
						the speed of sound more accurately. These experiments involved
						prominent members including Jacques Cassini, Pierre Louis
						Maupertuis, Claude Louis d'Épinay, and others. They were the first
						to state that with a prevailing wind speed denoted as
						<span class="italic">u</span>. In the direction of the wind sound
						propagates with speed <span class="italic">(c+u)</span> but against
						the wind with speed <span class="italic">(c-u)</span>. With their
						experiments they came to the value of
						<span class="italic">337m/s</span> for the speed of sound. While
						they concluded that the temperature does not affect the speed of
						sound but it was Italian scientist G.L. Bianconi who in 1740
						demonstrated by comparing velocities in winter and summer. He
						correctly concluded with rise in temperature the speed of sound
						increases and vice versa.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						The rest of the 18th century mostly about consolidating various
						studies. Joseph-Louis Lagrange Italian mathematician tackled
						Newton's reasoning on the elasticity of the medium and generalised
						his reasoning to cover sound waves with complex harmonics. However,
						the calculated values and the experimental data had large
						discrepancies. John Dalton an English chemist and physicist made
						observations on the behaviour of gases particularly around how
						sudden compression affects their temperature. Dalton found an
						important distinction between isothermal and adiabatic processes. An
						<span class="italic">isothermal process</span> is in which the
						temperature of medium remains constant since it can exchange heat
						with its surroundings. If a gas is compressed slowly it has time to
						release heat to the environment preventing temperature change. The
						change of volume with change in pressure in isothermal conditions is
						directly proportional to the static pressure of the gas. An
						<span class="italic">adiabatic process</span> is in which there is
						no heat transfer from the medium to its surroundings (i.e. no heat
						is gained or lost). This happens when the compression is rapid as
						there is no time for heat exchange to happen. In such cases the gas
						heats up significantly. Dalton noted that assuming isothermal
						conditions for sound waves might be incorrect and for rapid
						compressions like sound waves adiabatic conditions should be
						applied. This led to Pierre-Simon Laplace a French scholar to revise
						Newton's equation to <span class="italic">c = √γp/e</span> where γ
						is called the <span class="italic">adiabatic index</span>.
						<span class="italic">γ = C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>v</sub></span> where
						C<sub>p</sub> is the heat capacity needed to raise the temperature
						of gas by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 Kelvin) at a
						<span class="italic">constant pressure</span>. C<sub>v</sub> is the
						heat capacity required to raise the temper by 1 degree Celsius (or 1
						Kelvin) at a <span class="italic">constant volume</span>. Although
						inclusion of γ brought the calculated and observed values into
						agreement it was still not obvious that sound propagation was
						completely adiabatic process. Sir George Stokes an Irish
						mathematician and physicist showed that sound propagation has to be
						either substantially isothermic or substantially adiabatic else
						large damping factors and high attenuation would be observed and
						helped clear lingering doubts. Karl Ferdinand Herzfeld an
						Austrian-American physicist and Francis Owen Rice an English chemist
						showed that for an unbounded wave (wave that propagates through an
						infinite or large medium without significant constraints or
						reflections from boundaries) the time required for temperature to
						achieve equilibrium is proportional to the square of the wave
						length, whereas the actual time available for this to occur is
						directly proportional to the wavelength. This confirms that sound is
						an adiabatic process.
					</p>
					<p class="italic mb-10">
						With time other techniques for measuring the speed were put forward.
						However, experimenting in open air hindered in getting an accurate
						speed of sound. A wind speed of 8km/hr corresponds to a possible
						error of 2.2m/s. Also, a change of temperature of 1 degree Celsius
						produces a speed change of about 0.6m/s.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						<span class="italic">Is light a wave?</span> Light travels in a
						straight line, you can hear sounds around a corner but certainly
						can't see. <span class="italic">Interference</span> is a fundamental
						property of waves where two or more waves superpose to form a
						combined wave. The result depends on the phases of the signals
						interacting leading to constructive or destructive interference.
						Constructive interference happens when the waves meet in phase i.e.
						their peaks and troughs align. The amplitude of the resulting wave
						is the sum of the amplitude of the individual waves. Destructive
						interference occurs when the waves meet out of phase i.e. one wave's
						peak aligns with the other's trough. The amplitude of the resulting
						wave is the difference of the individual amplitudes. Interference is
						a property only of waves. Detection of object at point locations
						only happens with particles. The result of the double slit
						experiment by Thomas Young is that on the photographic plate you get
						an interference pattern, but the pattern is composed of a smattering
						of point-wise detections. If it were just a particle, you would not
						get the interference pattern. If if were just a wave, you would not
						get the point-wise detections. No wave like interference effects are
						very evident for light. Sound is compressions in air, if light is a
						wave, what is it waving? It's not air since light comes from the sun
						which is so far where there is no air. Despite, around 1800 it was
						established that light is a wave. The wavelength is just really
						short. Light wavelength is about
						<span class="italic">one fifty thousands</span> of an inch. Compared
						to the wavelength detected by human ears is about half an inch.
						<br />
						<br />
						<span class="italic"
							>So, if light is a wave just what is it waving?</span
						>
						<br />
						Sound needs a medium to travel, it can travel through solids,
						liquids, and gases. It was natural to assume that light too travels
						through a medium and this mysterious medium was called
						<span class="italic">aether</span>. This medium must fill all space
						out to the stars because we can see them so aether has to fill it to
						let light travel.
						<br />
						<br />
						<span class="italic underline"
							>Detecting ether: the Michelson-Morley experiment</span
						>
						<br />
						Michelson and Morley used an
						<span class="italic">interferometer</span> an instrument that could
						split a light beam into two perpendicular paths using a half
						silvered mirror. The initial light beam was split into two beams
						traveling at right angles to each other. The beams traveled a fixed
						distance were reflected back and recombined to form an interference
						pattern. The expectation was that if aether fills space the beam
						traveling along the direction of earth's motion would experience the
						aether wind and would slow down compared to the beam traveling
						perpendicular to earth's motion. he experiment's outcome was
						surprising:
						<span class="font-bold"
							>no shift in the interference pattern was detected</span
						>, regardless of the direction of the light beams or Earth's
						movement.
						<br />
						Michelson performed series of experiments but without any luck. The
						only possible conclusion from this series of experiments was that
						the whole concept of an all pervading aether was wrong from the
						start. Albert Einstein addressed this with his
						<span class="italic">Theory of Special Relativity</span> in 1905.
						Einstein proposed that the speed of light is a fundamental constant
						in nature, unaffected by the motion of the observer or source,
						eliminating the need for the aether concept altogether.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						So what does this have to do with the speed of sound? Thomas Carlyle
						Hebb while working at Ryerson Physical Laboratory in the USA made
						direct measurement in free air of the wavelength of the sound
						corresponding to a signal of known frequency using the method
						devised by Michelson for measuring light wavelength.
						<br />
						Two paraboloidal reflectors (focal length approximately 0.38 m,
						diameter 1.5 m) were arranged coaxially, one of them being moveable
						on a parallel track. A pure- tone air-whistle source whose frequency
						f = 2376.5 Hz was found by comparison with a tuning fork, was placed
						at the focus of one of the mirrors whilst a carbon microphone was
						placed at the focus of each of the mirrors. Using a split-primary
						transformer the outputs of the two microphones were combined in such
						a way that when the output from the secondary was monitored using
						headphones the sound heard was proportional to the vector sum of the
						two microphone outputs. This method therefore provided a direct
						determination of wavelength and, as the frequency was known, this
						yielded the sound velocity. The experiment was carried out in a hall
						36m long, thus no wind was encountered and the temperature was found
						to remain very constant. The separation between mirrors could be
						increased to as much as 100 λ and the positions of the minima could
						be located to within about 1 cm, so that an accuracy of the order of
						0.1% was achieved. In this way Hebb reported a value of c<sub
							>o</sub
						>
						= <span class="italic">(331.29 ± 0.04) m/s</span> but subsequently
						he revealed that this result was slightly in error due to the method
						he had used to correct the velocity measured in air containing
						moisture to obtain the dry air value. His revised estimate for dry
						air was remarkable c<sub>o</sub> = 331.41 m/s. Cyril M. Harris an
						acoustic engineer made careful measurements of relative sound
						velocity and showed that at room temperature it reaches a minimum
						value at relative humidity of about 14% at which point it is
						approximately 0.2 m/s lower than the dry-air value: at 100% Relative
						Humidity (RH) the velocity is about 1.1 m/s higher than the dry air
						value. It is this value of
						<span class="italic font-bold">331m/s</span> which is commonly
						referenced to in text books today.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						The speed (velocity = speed with direction) of sound in dry air is
						generally given as: V<sub>sound in air</sub> ≈ 331.6 + 0.6
