					Writing Sanskrit

						Sanskrit originated as an oral language and doesn't have a writing
						system of its own. You might say well all languages are oral and
						that is true but for most of Sanskrit's life it was never written
						down. Since writing was invented much later after spoken language it
						is fair to say that all languages are oral but a writing system was
						exclusively developed for some spoken language. For eg. Cuneiform
						the writing system was specifically invented to write down Sumerian.
						Cuneiform was used to manage accounting of things like livestock or
						commodities. Egyptian Heiroglyphs were invented around the same time
						as Cuneiform. The first attested script used to write Chinese was
						the Oracle Bone script dating back to 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC.
						It was already in a fully functional and mature state when we first
						saw it due to its highly abstract nature and consisting of major
						types pf Chinese characters. Apart from Cuneiform, Heiroglyphs and
						Old Bone script were already in a mature state when we discovered
						them which clearly implies an earlier period of development of
						several hundred years.
						<br />
						So what Sanskrit different? The primary script used to write
						Sanskrit is called Devanāgari but that's the thing Devanāgari was
						not invented for writing Sanskrit. During it's lifecycle various
						scripts have been used to write Sanskrit. Some of the scripts having
						been used to write Sanskrit are:

						An important thing to note here is that a lot of the scripts above
						have evolved from <span class="font-bold">Brahmi script</span> and
						many of these scripts are now obsolete.
						<br />
						<span class="underline">Major Indian scripts</span> namely
						Devanāgari, Bengali, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Oriya, Telugu,
						Malayalam were widely used by people in religious, ceremonial and
						scholarly works.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Grantha</span> was the widely used script in
						Tamil region to write Sanskrit as writing in Tamil was not suitable.
						The modern Malayalam, Tigalari, Sinhala, Thai, Javanese, etc. are
						derived from this swcript.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Sharada</span> was the principle literary
						script used in Kashmir to write Sanskrit. The modern Gurumukhi
						script is derived from this script.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Ranjana</span> is a beautiful calligraphic
						script primarily used in Nepal. A variation of this script called
						Lantsha, Wartu is used in Tibet and parts of China.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Newar</span> also known as Nepali script is
						used to write Nepal Bhasha (language) and Sanskrit. It is quite
						similar to Bengali and Devanāgari.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Tirhuta</span> also known as Maithili was
						used in Bihar and Nepal to write Maithili language and Sanskrit.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Tigalari</span> is used in coastal region of
						Karnataka which is a derivative of Grantha.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Sinhala</span> is used to write Sinhala and
						Sanskrit in Sri Lanja. Many Buddhist works are written in this
						script.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Nandinagari</span> was mainly used in
						Karnataka to write only Sanskrit which is derived from Nagari the
						precursor to Devanāgari.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Siddham</span> is a Buddhist script
						developed in North India but currently used in Japan, China and
						Korea to only write Sanskrit. It is a highly calligraphic and
						aesthetic script.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Bhaikshuki</span> was used around the 11<sup
							>th</sup
						>
						and 12<sup>th</sup> centuries CE in eastern parts of India and parts
						of Tibet and Nepal.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Kharoshthi</span> is an ancient script
						written from left to right and was used to write Sanskrit and
						Gandhari. It was in use from the middle of 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC
						until it died in its homeland around the 3<sup>rd</sup> century CE
						in present day Afghanistan and Pakistan.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Tamil and Gurumukhi (Punjabi)</span> do not
						contain complete repertoire of Sanskrit letters and hence are rarely
						used for Sanskrit and even if they are used to write it they are
						modified.
						<br />
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Tibetan</span> a Buddhist script derived
						from Brahmi used in Vajrayana Buddhism is used to write religious
						Sanskrit works in Tibet, Nepal, and MOngolia.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Phags-Pa</span> is a script written
						vertically and is derived from Tibetan used in Mongolia and Tibet to
						write various languages including Sanskrit.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Soyombo and Zanabazar Square</span> scripts
						are influenced by Tibetan and developed in Mongolia.
						<br />
						<span class="font-bold">Mongolian Galik</span> is non Brahmi script
						used to write Sanskrit.
						<br />
						Several historic scripts derived from Central Asian Bhrahmi script
						are
						<span class="font-bold">Tocharian, Khotanese, Tumshuqese</span> and
						so called <span class="font-bold">Uighar Brahmi</span> are
						collectively known as Turkestani used to Sanskrit.
						<br />
						<br />
						Sanskrit can now be also written in Latin script with modification
						named International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sanskrit has been written in over 40 different scripts throughout
						its history! Sanskrit is script-agnostic. But most of those scripts
						are derivatives of the Brahmi script. Brahmi script is an ancient
						writing system ancestor to all Indian scripts except Kharoshthi. Its
						origin is uncertain and debatable as academics are still fighting
						over how the script was developed. It first appears as fully
						developed system in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE found on
						inscriptions on rocks from emperor Ashoka's reign.
						<br />
						The Devanāgari script used for writing Sanskrit and other Indian
						languages has evolved over a period of more than two thousand years.
						Following timeline has been documented showing the overall
						development of Brahmi evolving into the Devanāgari script.
