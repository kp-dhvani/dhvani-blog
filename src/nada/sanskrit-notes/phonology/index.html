						Sound: The fabric of our reality?
					</h2>
					<p class="text-center mb-2">Auṃ ॐ</p>
					<p>
						As per the Hindu cosmogony, this primordial sound is what the
						supreme deity Brahmā who emerged from a lotus from the navel of lord
						Viṣṇu (विष्णु) uttered which generated the five great elements
						Pañcamahābhūta (पञ्चमहाभूत) :
					</p>
					<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Ākāśa (आकाश): Ether/Space first element formed from the vibration
							of Aum.
						</li>
						<li>Vāyu (वायु): Air from ether's motion</li>
						<li>Agni (अग्नि): Fire from air's friction</li>
						<li>Jala (जल): Water when fire condenses</li>
						<li>Pṛthvī (पृथ्वी): Earth when water solidifies</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						The universe emerges from nāda (नाद) the primordial sound. Nāda
						Brahmā (नाद ब्रह्मा) i.e. the sound of creation is considered the
						foundation of existence.
					</p>

						Bhartṛhari (भर्तृहरि) was a Hindu linguistic, philosopher, and a
						poet circa 5<sup>th</sup> century
						<abbr title="common era">CE</abbr>. He is best know for his work
						Vākyapadīya (वाक्यपदीय) which is treatise on sentences and words. In
						the first verse of his book he states:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
							अनादिनिधनं ब्रह्म शब्दतत्त्वं यदक्षरम् ।
						</p>
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed mb-2">
							विवर्ततेऽर्थभावेन प्रक्रिया जगतो यतः ॥ १ ॥
						</p>
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">

						</p>
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
							"The Brahman who is without beginning or end, whose very essence
							is the Word, who is indestructible, who appears as the objects,
							from whom the creation of the world proceeds."
						</p>

					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Across different cultures we see a similar phenomena. Christianity
						places a big emphasis on the power of sound through words.
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed mb-2">
							"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
							Word was God. Through Him all things were made; without Him,
							nothing was made that has been made."
						</p>

					<p class="mb-2">
						In Christian worships practices, believers connect to the divine
						through hymns, psalms, and chants. Gregorian chant was foundational
						to early Western music influencing the development of polyphony,
						musical notation, sacred compositional traditions, etc.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						The act of creation in Judaism too is linked to speech. Jewish
						tradition teaches that the world was created through ten divine
						utterances. The utterances from Genesis include "Let there be light"
						and other statements from God. The blowing of <em>shofar</em> a
						trumpet made from the horn of a kosher animal with the marrow
						removed during Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) and at the
						conclusion of Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) shows the significant
						role played by sound in Jewish rituals.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						In Islam, the Quran describes the act of creation as. being
						initiated by the divine command <em>Kun</em> which means "Be". The
						full phrase is "Kun Fayakun" meaning "be, and it is". Appearing 8
						times in the Quran, it symbolises the instantaneous nature of divine
						creation: when Allah wills something to exist, it exists
						immediately.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						In Sikhism, <em>Shabad</em> (Divine Word) and <em>Naam</em> (Divine
						Name) are central to the creation of this world.
						<em>Hukum</em> (Divine Command/Will/Order) governs the creation.
						<em>Guru Granth Sahib</em> the holy scripture of Sikhism talks about
						the practice of <em>Kirtan</em>, the singing of hymns as a a form of
						devotion to foster a deep connection with the Creator.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Several Native American cultures believe that songs and sounds are
						not just tools for communication but are sacred and shape the world.
						The Hopi people identifies the role of singing in their cosmology
						where the <em>Creator Taiowa</em> first conceived the world and
						<em>Sotuknang</em> his nephew executed the creation through the
						power of sound and song. The Lakota people have ceremonies like the
						<em>Sun Dance</em> or the use of the <em>Sacred Pipe</em> with
						scared songs that are believed to sustain the cosmic order. The
						songs are believed to be "language of the spirits", allowing for a
						direct connection with the divine. For the Navajo people the
						<em>Holy Wind (Níłch’i)</em> is the source of all movement, breath
						and speech. Chanting in ceremonies is designed to re-align the
						individual with the Holy Wind to restore beauty.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						In many African cultures drumming sounds, chanting and singing plays
						a big role in spiritual practice. The Dogon people of Mali of West
						Africa believe that Creator <em>Amma</em>, began the universe with
						vibrations and is often compared to the weaving process where sound
						and vibration are the threads that create the fabric of reality.
						These vibrations are symbolised by drums which is a sacred
						instrument that plays the rhythms of creation. The Yoruba people use
						<em>Oriki</em>, praise poetry to call forth the spiritual power of
						the ancestors into their physical realm. It is believed to carry the
						power of creation as it invokes the energy of the
						<em>Orishas</em> (deities). Across many African cultures, the drum
						is a scared instrument that bridges humanity to divine. the
						<em>Djembe Drum</em> is believed to carry the heartbeat of earth.
						The drumbeat is associated with the pulse of life.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						In Chinese philosophy, <em>Daoism (Taoism)</em> and the concept of
						<em>Dao (Tao)</em> are tied to sound and vibration which is the
						ultimate principle that governs the universe. Sound and vibration
						are seen as manifestations of the Dao's flow and harmony. Japanese
						<em>Shinto</em> and Buddhist traditions too reflect the belief in
						the power of vibration and resonance. In Shinto
						<em>Kotodama</em> "the spirit of words" empahsises that spoken words
						carry spiritual power.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Ancient Egyptians and Greek had similar outlook of sound being the
						force in the creation of this universe. As per the Egyptian
						<em>Memphis creation myth</em>, the creation is attributed to
						<em>Ptah</em> which was not a physical but an intellectual creation
						by the Word and the Mind of the God. Ptah's creative thought and
						speech were believed to have caused the formation of <em>Atum</em>,
						the primordial God from whom all arose and <em>Ennead</em> a group
						of 9 deities including Atum. The Greeks believed that the universe
						was governed by an intrinsic order often described as
						<em>Kosmos</em> which was reflected in music, mathematics, and the
						natural world. Spoken word held an utmost importance in the Greek
						mythology. As seen by the myths of <em>Orpheus</em>, the legendary
						musician and poet who could charm animals and even influence gods
						with this powerful songs and words.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						I hope you get where I am going with these examples these analogies
						with respect to sound and how from millennia we have tried to make
						sense of our reality and the creation of this universe. Humans are
						phenotypic creatures, we focus more on what we see rather what we
						hear. Audition is secondary while sight is primary. But as soon we
						shift out attention to just sound we find that it is just as
						important as any other medium of perception.
