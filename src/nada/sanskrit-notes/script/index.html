						Introduction: The script-agnostic nature of Sanskrit
					</h2>
					<p>
						Open any Sanskrit text and you'll find something unusual: it could
						be written in elegant Devanāgarī, angular Bengali, flowing Thai,
						geometric Tibetan—even read right to left or top to bottom. Why?
						Because Sanskrit doesn't belong to any one script, it belongs to all
						of them. Sanskrit started as an oral language and didn't have a
						writing system of its own for a really long time. You might say that
						all languages are oral and that's true but for most of Sanskrit's
						life it was never written down. Sure, writing came much later than
						spoken languages and that's true for all languages. But here's the
						difference: some languages got their own custom-made writing system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most languages have one writing system. English uses Latin letters.
						Arabic uses Arabic script. But Sanskrit is different. It has
						borrowed and adapted over 40 different writing systems throughout
						its history. Think about other ancient languages. Cuneiform was
						invented specifically for Sumerian. The earliest cuneiform tablets
						are primarily administrative records tracking livestock, grain, and
						other commodities. Over several centuries, it evolved from
						pictographic signs into a full writing system capable of expressing
						complete texts in Sumerian and later adapted for Akkadian, Hittite,
						and other languages. Egyptian Hieroglyphs were created for Egyptian.
						Chinese Oracle Bone script was developed for Chinese. These
						languages got custom built writing systems. So what
						<em>makes</em> Sanskrit different? Sanskrit, by contrast, was never
						given a purpose built script as it has always borrowed and adapted
						existing writing systems. It just borrowed whatever script was
						locally available. The primary script used to write Sanskrit is
						called Devanāgarī but was not invented for writing Sanskrit. During
						its lifecycle various scripts have been used to write Sanskrit. Some
						of the scripts used to write Sanskrit are:

						Brāhmī Script History
					</h2>
					<p>
						Sanskrit has been written in over 40 different scripts throughout
						its history! Sanskrit is script-agnostic. But most of those scripts
						are derivatives of the Brāhmī script. Brāhmī script is an ancient
						writing system ancestor to all Indian scripts except Kharoshthi. Its
						origin is uncertain and debatable as academics are still fighting
						over how the script was developed. It first appears as fully
						developed system in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century
						<abbr title="Before the Common Era">BCE</abbr> found on inscriptions
						on rocks from emperor Ashoka's reign. The inscription on the
						original Sarnath pillar is known as the Schism Edict, warning
						against division within the Buddhist Sangha (monastic community).
						Translation:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">

						Devanāgarī: The Abugida script
					</h2>
					<p class="mb-5">
						The name Abugida comes from the Ethiopian Ge'ez script and is formed
						from the first four syllables
						<em>'ä, bu, gi, da</em> similar to how we say <em>a, b, c, d</em> in
						English. Abugida is one of the three major
						<strong>phonetic</strong> writing system types. In an
						<em>Alphabet</em> (like Latin/English) vowels have equal status to
						consonants and have separate letters. The word "alphabet" comes from
						the first two Greek letters <em>alpha</em> and <em>beta</em>. In an
						<em>Abjad</em> (like Arabic or Hebrew) only consonants are written
						with vowels absent or marked optionally.
						<em
							>In an Abugida like Brāhmī or Devanāgarī each basic symbol
							represents a consonant with an inherent vowel and in Sanskrit this
							vowel is "a" (अ).</em
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Sanskrit now is primarily written in Devanāgarī which is an Abugida
						script. An Abugida is a writing system where each basic symbol
						represents a consonant with an inherent vowel and form a
						consonant-vowel unit. Each unit is based on a primary consonant and
						a secondary vowel. Vowels are indicated by modifying marks to the
						base consonant using something called as diacritic marks. This is
						how it works for Devanāgarī:
					</p>
					<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Each letter = consonant + default vowel. In the case of Sanskrit
							the default vowel is "a".
						</li>
						<li>
							To write other vowels you add marks to the consonant. In
							Devanāgarī the sign for the vowel following a consonant is then
							added to right, to the left, above or below the consonant sign.
						</li>
						<li>To write just a consonant (no vowel) you use a special mark</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Example: Base consonant क = "ka"
						<br />
						To write different vowels with क
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 my-2">
						<li>कि = add mark ि for ki</li>
						<li>की = add mark ी long "ī" kī</li>
						<li>कु = add mark ु for ku</li>
						<li>कू = add mark ू for long "ū" kū</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-5">
						<b>There is no sign indicating the vowel: a</b>. It is the most
						frequent vowel in Sanskrit and seemed most economical to have its
						presence <em>assumed</em> whenever no other other vowel was
						explicitly present.
						<br />
						To write just क "k" with no vowel: क्
						<br />
						In Devanāgarī the mark ् to indicate the absence of a vowel is
						called a Virāma a small diagonal stroke below the consonant sign.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						This works well for when a consonant has a vowel but what happens
						when a consonant is instantly followed by another consonant? Such
						consonants are called
						<em>Conjunct consonants</em> where two or more consonants appear
						together without a vowel between them. In English words like
						<em>street ("s", "t", "r" together)</em>,
						<em>spring ("s", "p", "r" together)</em>,
						<em>play ("p", "l" together)</em> are a form of conjuncts.
						<br />
						For conjuncts in Devanāgarī, using Virāma is done almost exclusively
						at the end of words whose last sound is a consonant. In other cases
						we need to combine the two consonants in writing. This can be
						achieved by omitting the right hand vertical element of the first
						sign. Example:
						<br />
						maṇḍalaḥ -> circle
						<br />
						Here ṇ has no vowel and is followed by another consonant ḍ.
						<br />
						ण् ṇ + ड् ḍ = ण्ड् -ṇḍ-
						<br />
						मण्डल: -> circle
						<br />
						Let's look at another example:
						<br />
						ātmā -> soul
						<br />
						त् + म् = त्म् -tm-
						<br />
						आत्मा -> soul
						<br />
						Sometimes a letter does not have a vertical element or cannot be
						combined with the next letter for some reason. In such cases letters
						are made smaller and stacked on top of one another.

						Devanāgarī: The modern face of Sanskrit
					</h2>
					<p>
						The word <em>Devanāgarī</em> is formed by combining two words:
						<em>deva (देव)</em> meaning a male deity or divinity and
						<em>nāgari (नागरी)</em> which is an adjective derived from
						<em>nagara (नगर)</em> meaning town or city which can be used to talk
						about an urban city. Perhaps it was named as the script was
						associated with religious texts but Sanskrit had a larger atheistic
						literature than exists in any other classical languages including
						Greek, Latin, Arabic, Chinese, etc. So Devanāgarī being the script
						of the divinity does not hold true in any sense. The exact meaning
						of the word is unclear as to why was the script named this way.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Devanāgarī today is used to write 3 major languages: Hindi (more
						than 500 million speakers), Marathi (around 80-90 million speakers),
						and Nepali (around 15 million speakers). As we have seen above,
						Sanskrit in its lifetime was written in many different scripts but
						in the modern era Sanskrit texts are printed and shared mostly in
						Devanāgarī. So, the question arises why Devanāgarī?
					</p>
					<h3 class="mb-2 text-sm underline">Early European Printing</h3>
					<p>
						Indian literary traditions historically were largely oral where
						writing played a secondary role. Most written records from the
						pre-modern era were in the form of inscriptions and manuscripts.
						Despite the established and highly cultivated manuscript tradition
						of India, typography was a European import to the region and the
						technology was designed around the Latin script. Latin centrism led
						to modifications in the stacked conjuncts and vowel diacritics as
						they were easier to represent linearly in typography. The earliest
						evidence of printed Devanāgarī comes from the 1667 book
						<em lang="la">China Illustrata</em> published by German Jesuit
						Athnasius Kircher which compiles 17<sup>th</sup> century European
						knowledge on the Ming era Chinese empire and its neighbouring
						countries which includes India. He himself had never been to China
						but compiled the oral and written reports from former Jesuit
						missionaries to publish the knowledge on China and Tibet. However,
						the Devanāgarī in the book was printed using woodblock engraving and
						not metal movable types.

						British Calcutta and the First Indian Typefaces
					</h3>
					<p class="mb-2">
						When the British arrived in India, they had 3 cities in mind to
						setup their base - Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Mumbai was under the
						Portuguese control and also made them vulnerable to resistance from
						Marathas who were at that time the strongest opposing force in the
						country. Chennai was too far from the north so would have been a
						difficult place to setup a trade base. Kolkata, named Calcutta by
						the British however had a weak Mughal ruler Siraj-ud-Daulah. After
						the British East India Company gained control of Bengal in 1757,
						they established Calcutta (Kolkata) as their administrative center.
						This made it the hub for European study of Indian languages. The
						East India Company transitioned from traders to landlords gaining
						control of all Bengal. The defeated Indian rulers were forced to
						sign the treaty, granting the East India Company Divāni rights,
						which allowed them to collect revenue from the territories of
						Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa on behalf of the Mughal emperor. Kolkata
						was rich and educated with significant advantages. The area provided
						abundant supply of fertile land, fish, and meat. The river Ganga
						opened the floodgates of opportunities by setting up ports for
						business through the river which connected to the Bay of Bengal.
						They could also build inroads without bothering Portuguese who
						controlled Mumbai, Goa, Cochin, and Pondicherry. Hence, Kolkata
						became the capital of the British trade company. The Company's
						transition from traders to rulers meant they needed to understand
						local languages for administration. This is why European scholars
						began studying Bengali and Sanskrit in Kolkata not out of pure
						academic interest, but colonial necessity.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						<strong
							>This concentration of wealth, power, and trade made Kolkata the
							natural center for European scholarship in India.</strong
						>
						And when scholars wanted to study Sanskrit and Bengali, they needed
						printing presses which meant they needed Indian craftsmen who could
						create the types.
					</p>
					<p>
						Soon Europeans who would come to Kolkata began to study the local
						culture and languages. Sir William Jones a British philologist and a
						judge who served in Kolkata founded the famous
						<em>The Asiatic Society</em> to enhance and further the cause of
						<em>Oriental research</em> which in this case was India and its
						surrounding region. Some of the early members were Charles Wilkins
						and Alexander Hamilton. In his famous
						<em>Third Anniversary Discourse to the Asiatic Society</em>
						delivered on February 2 1786 he made the groundbreaking observation
						about the relationship between Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin. His
						famous statement was:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
							"The Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a
							wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious
							than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet
							bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of
							verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been
							produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could
							examine them all three, without believing them to have spring from
							some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists: there is a
							similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that
							both the Gothick and the Celtick, though blended with a very

						Although, Bengal had its own script - Eastern Nagari script also
						known as Bengali-Assamese script, the British expanded further west
						into <em>Hindustani</em> speaking territories making 'Hindustani'
						texts part of their research in Kolkata. Few East India Company
						officials (EIC) like English Orientalist Nathaniel Brassey Halhed
						had already learned the Bengali language and wanted to print a book
						on the Bengali grammar but couldn't because there were no typeface
						available. Enter Charles Wilkins (co-founder of Asiatic Society) and
						Bengali blacksmith Panchanan Karmakar who developed the first ever
						metal cast for Bengali in 1778. Along with the Bengāli types they
						also worked on creating Persian types. The significant stride made
						was in 1778 with the book
						<em>A Grammar of the Bengal Language</em> by Halhed printed in the
						press of a Mr. Andrews at Hooghly, a small town about 25 kilometers
						from Kolkata. Wilkins designed the typeface and Karmakar physically
						cut the punches and cast the type. There were two very brief phrases
						in Persian script in this book which was printed using the Persian
						types.

					<p>
						Pañcānana Karmakāra is considered the father of Bengali typography.
						The Karmakāras were a family of skilled metalworkers and
						calligraphers based in Tribeni, Hooghly, known for inscribing names
						and decorations on copper plates, weapons, and metal vessels. One of
						Pañcānana's ancestors earned the title <em>Mullick</em> from Nawab
						Alivardi Khan for his exceptional craftsmanship in carving sword and
						shield designs a testament to the family's generations of expertise
						in metalwork.

					<p class="mb-2">
						Charles Wilkins came to Bengal in 1770 as a clerk working for the
						EIC and was the first Englishman to learn Sanskrit. He also
						translated <em lang="sa">Hitopadeśa</em>,
						<em lang="sa">Bhagavadgītā</em>, and
						<em lang="sa">Śakuntalā</em> into English. Around 1778, inspired by
						his friend Nathaniel Brassey Halhed Wilkins began studying Sanskrit.
						He found "a Pandit of a liberal mind" who helped him learn Sanskrit
						though he didn't name this teacher. Later he moved to Vārāṇasī, the
						greatest center of traditional Hindu learning in India to work with
						the best Sanskrit scholars and met Paṇḍita Kāśīnātha Bhaṭṭācārya to
						teach him the inner workings of the language. At this point no
						Sanskrit-English dictionaries existed so Kāśīnātha compiled
						fundamental reference works for Wilkins with a list of Sanskrit verb
						roots called Dhātumañjarī meaning "Garland of Roots". Wilkins
						translated the Gīta while in India (1784), and it was published in
						London (May 1785) while he was still in India. Wilkins returned back
						to England in 1786. Although In the year 1795, residing in the
						countryside England, he began to arrange his materials on his
						learning of Sanskrit language and prepare them for publication.
						<em
							>He cut letters in steel, made matrices and moulds, and cast from
							them a fount of types of the Devanāgarī characters, all with his
							own hands.</em
						>
						Unfortunately, on the 2nd of May 1795, his house burnt down and he
						lost the typefaces in the fire, but luckily he was able to save all
						of his books, manuscripts, and most of the punches and matrices.
						Wilkins gave up on the idea of publishing his grammar, but the
						establishment of the East India College at Haileybury in 1805, which
						required Sanskrit instruction, encouraged him to resume the project.
						He had new types cast from his saved matrices and published his
						<em>Grammar of the Sanskrita Language</em> in London in 1808.
					</p>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, Karmakar continued working on improving the Bengāli metal
						types as seen in the book
						<em lang="bn">Iṅgarāji o Vāṅgāli vokebilari</em> published by Aaron
						Upjohn to help English speakers and beginners learn the Bengāli
						language where the typeface was different compared to Halhed's book.
					</p>
					<p>
						Printing in Bengal was more of a political matter where books on
						Bengāli were printed to promote administrative efficiency in the
						EIC, the needs of religion actually helped further the cause of
						printing. Towards the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century EIC decided
						to steer away from the missionary activity and forbidden it among
						the confines of the Company's Indian dominions. William Carey a
						worker of the Baptist mission arrived in Kolkata on November 11,
						1795. Since EIC had banned missionary work he had to carry his work
						in secret. He knew that to fulfill his missionary work he needed to
						have an immense knowledge of the local language and hence he started
						learning Bengāli to translate the New Testment and completed the
						first translation by 1797. To adequately translate the Christian
						scriptures he also started learning Sanskrit. In a letter written in
						1798 he wrote:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
							"I am learning the Sanskrit language, which, with only the helps
							to be procured here, is perhaps the hardest language in the world.
							To accomplish this, I have nearly translated the Sanskrit Grammar
							and dictionary into English, and have made considerable progress
							in compiling a dictionary, Sanskrit including Bengali and
							English."

					</blockquote>
					<p class="mb-2">
						After completing his New Testment translation he started looking for
						ways to publish it. He procured a wooden printing machine for
						&pound;40 but obtaining Bengāli alphabet types was more difficult.
						Initially he planned to get punches of the Bengāli alphabet from
						London but it proved to be a too costly approach. He learnt about a
						foundary (a type making factory) but couldn't trace the whereabouts
						of the factory. In this process he did learn about a technician who
						had received training in the art of making types of Indian alphabets
						from Sir Charles Wilkins and was available for employment. This
						technician was of course Pañcānana Karmakāra. Carey went on to
						publish multiple books in Bengāli.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the beginning of 1799 Carey was joined by 2 other missionaries to
						assist him and they moved to the Danish settlement of Serampore as
						they couldn't find a settlement in Company's dominion of Kidderpore.
						Here he started the Serampore press with the other 2 missionaries.
						An extract from a letter written by him dated February 5, 1800:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
							"The setting up of the press would have been useless at
							Mudnabatty, without brother Ward, and perhaps might have been
							ruined, if it had been attempted. At this place, we are settled
							out of the Company's dominions and under the government of a power
							very friendly to us and our designs."

						A historian of the mission work asserts that the Karmakāra met Carey
						only after they had settled down at Serampore. He writes:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
						<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
							"At the beginning of 1803, the missionaries had made considerable
							progress in the preparation of a fount of Deva Nagree types. The
							Deva Nagree is the parent of all the various Indian alphabets,
							and, according to the mythological tradition, the special gifts of
							the gods. This was the first fount of this type which had been
							attempted in India. Soon after the establishment of the press at
							Seerampore, the native blacksmith Punchanon, who had instructed
							the art of punch cutting by Sir Charles Wilkins, came to the
							Missionaries in search of employment. Mr. Carey was then
							contemplating a Sanskrit Grammar, for which it was necessary to
							obtain Nagree types, and Punchanon was immediately engaged for the
							work."

						In 1801 Carey was appointed as the professor of Bengāli and Sanskrit
						at the Fort William College of Calcutta. This made his attention
						turn to printing books on non-religious subjects for the use of his
						students. It was due to this that he asked Karmakāra to work on
						creating types for Devanāgarī so he could print his book
						<em>A Grammar of the Sungskrit Language</em> which required almost
						700 separate punches.
						<em
							>Towards the end of 1804 Hetopudes (Hitopadeśa), the first

						Unfortunately, I couldn't find a copy online since the book is rare
						and there's no digital copy available anywhere on the internet. He
						also published a Marathi Grammar book using Devanāgarī types but
						eventually moved to the Modi script types which was being used to
						write Marathi in Maharashtra.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although Charles Wilkins had prepared the Devanāgarī types script as
						early as 1795, his book on the Sanskrit grammar was not published
						until 1808. In fact Carey's grammar books on Marathi was published
						in 1805 and his grammar book on Sanskrit was published in 1806.
						There is a book in the National Library Kolkata, called
						<em>Grammar of the Hindustanee Language</em> by John Gilchrist,
						printed at the Chronicle Press in Calcutta in 1796 which uses
						Devanāgarī types. This is probably the earliest instance of
						Devanāgarī printing in India but uses wooden movable types instead
						of metal.

						Colonial Impact on Modern Devanāgarī
					</h3>
					<p>
						This style of printing Devanāgari had a huge impact on the language.
						Europeans introduced Western style punctuations and spacing into
						their printed texts something that caught on and remains to this
						day. Traditional Sanskrit manuscripts used scriptio continua
						(continuous script without word spaces) and ancient grammars like
						Pāṇini's traditionally omit spaces between words with segmentation
						guided by Sandhi (more on Sandhi in a different article) rules that
						alter sounds. Traditional Devanāgari used only 3 punctuations marks
					</p>
					<ul
						class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2"
						aria-label="Traditional punctuation marks in Devanāgari"
					>
						<li>daṇḍa ( । ) - marks end of sentence or middle of verse</li>
						<li>double daṇḍa ( ॥ ) - marks end of paragraph or verse</li>
						<li>avagraha ( ऽ ) - marks vowel elision in sandhi</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-5">
						But modern Devanāgari texts make use of various English punctuation
						marks including exclamation marks, commas, question marks, etc.
						Conjunct formation was simplified compared manuscripts and
						inscriptions forms which reduced the number of unique types needed
						lowering costs as well. The famous Indologist William Jones declared
						Devanāgari to be the most ideal scripts for Sanskrit which was
						appreciated by Wilkins and later by the German Indologist Max
						Müller.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						With the advancements in the printing technology, it was still
						almost entirely an European endeavour - missionaries, the colonial
						state, and European entrepreneurs. As some scholars note, Indians
						only provided labour and received training in the various processes
						of typography. The primary readership of these European run presses
						was also European. Indians were just useful informants that helped
						guide the European type designers but were not the active drivers of
						the process.

						The Colonial Legacy: How Standardization Changed Sanskrit
					</h3>
					<p>
						The British decision to standardise on Devanāgarī had lasting
						effects:
					</p>
					<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							<strong>Loss of regional diversity:</strong> Before printing, each
							region used their familiar script. After standardisation, regional
							scripts declined for example: the Modī script used for writing
							Marāthi.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The "Devanāgarī = Sanskrit" myth:</strong> Today, most
							people think Devanagari is "the" Sanskrit script. But this is only
							200 years old a colonial creation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Simplified typography:</strong> Many traditional conjuncts
							were simplified or eliminated to make printing easier.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Western conventions:</strong> Punctuation, spacing, and
							layout conventions from Latin printing were imposed on Sanskrit
							texts.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 class="border-b border-gray-400 pb-1 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
					<p>
						So, why did Sanskrit become script agnostic? Because Sanskrit was
						primarily oral for so long, when regions started writing it, they
						used whatever script they already knew. There was no central
						authority dictating "Sanskrit must be written THIS way". This means
						you can learn Sanskrit in any script as long as you understand the
						fundamentals of the language.
					</p>
					<p>
						Can different scripts affect pronunciation? Short answer: No,
						they're just different ways to write the same sounds.
					</p>
					<p>
						Are texts translatable between scripts? Yes, completely! Same
						language, just different "clothes".
					</p>
					<p>
						The standardization on Devanāgarī created the modern myth that it's
						"the" Sanskrit script. But Sanskrit's script agnostic nature
						persists. You can still learn Sanskrit in any script—the sounds
						remain the same, only the visual representation changes. Here's
						what's remarkable: these scripts are just different ways to write
						the same sounds. The word 'namaste' looks completely different in
						each script, but it's pronounced identically:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>Devanāgarī: <span lang="sa">नमस्ते</span></li>
						<li>Bengali: <span lang="bn">নমস্তে</span></li>
						<li>Tamil (Grantha): <span lang="sa-Taml">நமஸ்தே</span></li>
						<li>Kannada: <span lang="kn">ನಮಸ್ತೇ</span></li>
						<li>Thai: <span lang="th">นมัสเต</span></li>
						<li>Khmer: <span lang="km">នមស្តេ</span></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Same word, same pronunciation—just different visual systems.</p>
					<p class="my-5">
						In the next article we will listen to the phonology of Sanskrit.
