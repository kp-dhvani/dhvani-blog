						After working on my simple 8 step sequencer which only generates a
						gate signal for each active step in the sequence I wanted to add the
						functionality to generate control voltage for modulating the pitch
						for each active step in the sequence. It's not much of a sequencer
						if it cannot generate pitch control voltage to make melodies. This
						is where things got tricky since I have a Daisy Pod which is has an
						AC coupled audio output. What does that even mean? Well everything
						in modular synthesis is simply variations in voltage. Some are AC
						like the audio and some are DC like control voltage. The reason why
						modular is so flexible and intuitive because it's only voltages
						flowing through the system and the same voltage can be used for
						audio generation or modulating some aspect of the audio. Daisy Pod
						has an AC coupled audio so it cannot generate DC voltages since AC
						coupled outputs have a capacitor in series with the output and any
						DC component of the voltage is blocked while only allowing AC
						components. To generate a pitch control voltage I should be able to
						generate a voltage of let's say 1V and be able to sustain it till
						the next active step in the sequence. Ok but why only DC? Why can't
						we use AC to generate the control voltage, it's voltage after all?
						Let's say you want to control the pitch of an oscillator and if you
						were to use AC coupling the control voltage would constantly return
						to 0V since AC alternates between positive and negative from a
						reference point which is 0V. So using AC for control voltage would
						lead to your pitch decaying and coming back to its original pitch.
						AC coupled devices have a capacitor in series with the output. A
						capacitor is so called because it has a
						<span class="italic">capacity</span> to store energy and is made of
						two conductive plates separated by an insulator or a dielectric.
						Dielectrics are materials possessing high electrical resistivities
						and a good dielectric is therefore a good insulator. A capacitor is
						a little like a battery. Although they work in different ways
						capacitors and batteries store electrical energy. However, a battery
						generates and stores energy while a capacitor only stores the
						energy. Once you apply a voltage to the capacitor it starts to
						charge up and as soon as it charges fully no more current can flow
						through it and if the voltage is DC capacitor will block the passage
						of the voltage since it's now fully charged. A capacitor responds to
						AC by continuously charging and discharging when the input voltage
						swings positive, electrons flow one way building up charge, but
						before the capacitor can fully charge, the AC voltage swings
						negative, causing electrons to flow in the opposite direction. This
						constant reversal of voltage creates continuous electron movement in
						the circuit. The capacitor does not
						<span class="italic">BLOCK</span> anything, it just recreates the
						voltage at its input and the next part in the circuit uses that to
						create current flow based on the voltage changes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ok so Daisy Pod has a DC coupled output so I cannot generate a pitch
						control voltage, what do I do now? Electro Smith the company who
						makes the Daisy Pod also makes other DSP modules. One of them is a
						Patch.init() module. This module's output is DC coupled which means
						it can pass both AC and DC voltages.

						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						But this does not have some controls like an encoder, multiple LEDs,
						toggle switches which is in Daisy Pod so to make my step sequencer I
						had to split the functionality between these two modules. Here is
						the setup:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-5">
						<li>
							In Daisy Pod use the encoder to step through the sequence. Use the
							toggle switch to turn on/off a step in the sequence. Use the knob1
							to control the tempo and knob2 to set a pitch for the active step
							in the sequence. Pod will generate the gate signal for each active
							step in the sequence. It will also generate an audio signal for
							the pitch selected for the step.
						</li>
						<li>
							Patch.init() will take the gate signal and the audio signal. It
							will forward the gate signal to my Moog Mavis gate input which
							will trigger its VCA. It will calculate the frequency of the
							incoming audio signal and turn that frequency to a voltage based
							on the 1V/Octave standard. This control voltage will then be fed
							to Moog Mavis 1V/OCT input to control the pitch of the oscillator.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Since Patch.init() audio output is DC coupled I can easily generate
						a pitch control voltage bt since it does not have enough hardware
						controls I am using the Pod to do half of the work. The tricky part
						here is calculating the frequency of the incoming audio signal and
						converting it to a pitch control voltage. I have spent a couple of
						days in getting the calculations right but so far I am not able to
						get the frequency calculation right and I observed that I kept
						making a lot of mistakes in my code and was often in completely
						wrong direction.
						<br />
						Rather than continuing to struggle with code, I realized I needed to
						step back and rebuild my foundation in Digital Signal Processing
						concepts. Without solid DSP fundamentals, I was trying to solve
						problems I didn't fully understand.
						<br />
						That was a brief of writing this article and let's get started
						understanding some basic concepts needed to work with DSP.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						Digital Signal Processing is a vast field with many different
						applications. I am using DSP primarily for working with audio
						signals. Ok so what is a signal? A signal is just a description of
						how one parameter is related to another. An audio signal is just
						voltage that varies over time. It's a continuous voltage signal that
						represents how air pressure will change with respect to change in
						electric potential of the voltage over time. Since both the
						parameters can assume continuous range of values, it is called a
						continuous signal. In comparison passing the signal through a
						digital system forces each of the parameters to be
						<span class="italic">quantised</span>. Quantising is the process
						mapping a continuous range of analog values to a finite set of
						digital values. This is called a discrete or digitised signal. For
						an audio signal the quantisation can be done with an Analog to
						Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC has a fixed number of resolution or
						bits. If we have a 12 bit ADC we now have a 2<sup>12</sup> possible
						set of values to represent each value in the signal. If you have a
						5V signal with a 12 bit ADC you can detect the smallest voltage of
						approximately 1.22mV.
						<br />
						5V/2<sup>12</sup> = 0.001220703125
						<br />
						Any voltage differences less than 1.22mV will be lost in the
						quantisation. [this can be explained separately in different article
						since it's quite an important concept]
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						If we were to plot a graph of the discrete signal the vertical axis
						can represent any parameter like sound pressure, voltage, etc. This
						parameter is called with other names:
						<span class="font-bold"
							>the dependent variable, the range and the ordinate</span
						>. The horizontal axis represents the other parameter of the signal
						going by names:
						<span class="font-bold"
							>the independent variable, the domain, the abscissa</span
						>. The two parameters that form the signal are not interchangeable.
						The parameter on the Y axis is said to be a function of the X axis.
						The independent variables tells when and how the samples were taken
						while the dependent variable is the actual measurement. Given a
						value on the X axis we can always find the respective Y axis value
						but usually not the other way around.
						<br />
						In DSP if a signal uses time as the independent variable then it is
						said to be in the time domain. Just like that if the independent
						variable is the frequency it is said to be in the frequency domain.
						The type of the parameter on the X axis makes it the domain of the
						signal.
					</p>
					<p class="underline">Signal vs the underlying process</p>
					<p>
						Let's play a probability game. We will create a signal out of
						flipping a coin and noting down its outcome. Let's we will flip our
						coin a 1000 times and generate a signal based on heads or tails. If
						the outcome is head the sample value is one and if tails the sample
						value is 0. The outcome here is 50/50 heads and tails. Each
						individual flip has an expected value of 0.5 which comes from this
						formula:
						<span class="italic"
							>probability of heads x value of heads + probability of tails +
							value of tails</span
						>. If you were to calculate the mean of the coin flip you'll get the
						mean as 0.5. This is the mean of the
						<span class="italic">underlying process</span> that helps generate
						our signal. But if you were to actually generate a signal and
						calculate its mean it is unlikely that it will have a mean of
						exactly 0.5. If you were to do a 1000 coin flips you'll find out
						that the outcome is not 500 heads and 500 tails. Due to the inherent
						nature of how particles behave and tiny changes in the air pressure,
						thermal vibrations of the atoms in the coin, the air bouncing off
						the coin, etc. will introduce randomness in the outcome. This
						introduces the quantum uncertainty in each coin flip. Getting an
						equal outcome of heads and tails on coin flips is really rare.
						<span class="italic"
							>The probabilities of the underlying process (the coin flip) are
							constant but the statistics of the acquired signal changes each
							time the experiment is repeated.</span
						>
						This randomness and the irregularity that we find in the actual data
						is called: statistical variation, statistical fluctuation or
						statistical noise. So now you have a signal which has error in it so
						when you process it you'll come across issues like voltage level
						might be higher ot lower than the true value, jitters in the signal,
						and a bunch of other problems in your calculations. So how do we fix
						it?
						<br />
						<br />
						Statistics is the science of interpreting numerical data such as an
						acquired signal. While probability is used to understand the
						processes that generates that signal. To fix the statistical noise
						we can use techniques like calculating the mean and standard
						deviation of the acquired sample forming the signal. In electronics
						the mean is called the DC value while AC refers to how the signal
						fluctuates around the mean value. If the signal is a simple one like
						a square or a sine wave its fluctuation can be described by its peak
						to peak amplitude. But most real life signals are not symmetric like
						that and have a well defined peak to peak value. So a generalised
						approach needs to be applied for such signals. Standard deviation is
						a measure of how much a sample deviates from its mean denoted by the
						Greek Sigma notation &sigma;.
						<br />
						To calculate how far the i<sup>th</sup> sample deviates from the
						mean we can use the formula |x<sub
							><span class="italic">i</span></sub
						>
						- &mu;|. Then the average deviation can be calculated by summing all
						the individual deviations. We also use the absolute value of the
						deviation otherwise positive and negative deviations would sum out
						to zero. But the average deviation is not in statistics since it
						does not fit with how signal physics works. Imagine the sound coming
						out of a speaker. The sound is generated by the speaker's diaphragm
						pushing outward and then inward from a center point. If we were to
						average out the diaphragm movement we'd reach a number closer to
						zero. If the average displacement of the diaphragm is zero how can
						it produce any sound? We are able to hear the sound coming from the
						speaker but statistically it's average is zero so there is
						definitely something wrong with our statistics here. So average
						deviation cannot be used here to make a correct estimation. That's
						where standard deviation comes in. What matters in statistics is not
						the deviation from the mean but the
						<span class="italic">power</span> of the deviation of the mean and
						standard deviation helps us calculate that correctly.
						<br />
						SD uses the signal power instead of the signal amplitude to
						calculate the deviation by first squaring the value (power &prop;
						voltage<sup>2</sup>). Squaring is needed to make the values absolute
						which gives us the power of the deviation of that value from the
						mean. Squaring matches how things work in nature. For eg. if you
						push something twice as hard you don't get twice the energy, you
						actually get four times the energy. Then summing all the values and
						calculating an average then and taking a square root to compensate
						for the first squaring. The formula for standard deviation is:

						hhhmmm something does not look right! Why are we dividing by N-1
						when we have N samples? When we take a sample out of a population
						for statistical measures the data always contains error. Remember
						the statistical noise mentioned above in the article. The error is
						represented as:

					<p class="my-2">
						Since N is in the denominator and if N is a small number the
						statistical noise will be large enough to throw our calculations
						away from the actual mean which means we do not have enough samples
						to characterise the process. Larger the value of N smaller the
						statistical noise. The law of large numbers guarantees the error
						becomes zero as N approaches infinity. Enter Bessel's Correction.
						Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel was a German mathematician among other
						things and he suggested using N - 1 instead of N which corrects the
						bias in a sample of population. When you have a finite set of sample
						from a given population, calculating a parameter like SD will not
						yield to a correct value. When you're working with a sample you've
						only got a small fraction of the population to work with. Your
						calculations are not going to be as accurate as they would have been
						if you had full entire set of data to work with.

						Any x value in your sample is closer to x&#772; than it is to &mu;.
						The sample mean is always smaller than the actual population mean.
						Dividing by N-1 instead of N moves the mean closer to the population
						mean. If N is large enough the N-1 difference does not matter, if N
						is small the replacement to N-1 provides an accurate estimate of the
						standard deviation of the underlying process. Division by N gives us
						the SD of the acquired signal and division by N-1 gives us the SD of
						the underlying process.
