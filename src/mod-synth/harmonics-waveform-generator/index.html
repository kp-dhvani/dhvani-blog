						Carefully listen to the sounds around you. The sound of a moving
						car, someone speaking in the distance, rustling of the tree leaves,
						birds chirping, all of these sounds that you hear can be recreated
						mathematically using a sine wave. Well not one sine wave but a
						combination of sine waves but that's for later in the article. Hmmm
						ok but what is a sine wave? A sine wave represents a motion, a
						motion that moves from a highest point, down through a middle point,
						to a lowest point and then back up again. Imagine this, you are on
						giant ferries wheel which takes 8 minutes to complete a rotation. It
						will look like the motion in figure A.
					</p>
					<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row w-full gap-2 my-5">
						<div class="w-full md:w-1/2">

						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						But let's say instead of looking at the wheel from the front we look
						at it from the side. Then what you will see as visualised in figure
						B is a line and the position of the rectangle move up and down the
						line. The 2 dimensional motion (vertical and horizontal) from the
						front view is converted to a one dimensional motion (vertical) on
						the side view. So if we start at time 0 in 2 minutes we reach the
						top of the wheel, in 4 minutes you're half way around, in 6 minutes
						you're at the bottom of the wheel and on the 8th minute you come
						back to where you started completing the full motion. Let's plot the
						position versus the time on a graph. The curve that you see is a
						sine wave. It represents a continuous periodic motion. The movement
						of the rectangle is up and down but when you plot this vertical
						movement on a time axis that's where the time axis gets its shape. A
						sine wave oscillates back and froth from the start position to a
						maximum amount in the either direction which is called its
						amplitude.
					</p>
					<div class="w-full lg:w-1/2 h-72 md:h-80 mx-auto mb-5">
						<canvas id="large-ferris-wheel-chart"></canvas>
					</div>
					<p>
						Another key concept thing to note here is if you a smaller ferries
						wheel but it still takes the same amount of time as the bigger wheel
						and we compare their sine wave with time only their amplitude
						changes i.e. the smaller wheel has lower amplitude than the bigger
						one and the wave only gets stretched in the vertical direction the
						as shown below.

						<canvas id="large-small-ferris-wheel-chart"></canvas>
						<p>Figure C: Large and small ferries wheel motion</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						Secondly, if you have 2 same size wheels but one takes longer to
						complete a full rotation the sine oscillation gets faster and you'll
						see that the sine wave only stretches in the horizontal direction
						i.e. the time axis as shown below.

						<canvas id="slow-fast-ferris-wheel-chart"></canvas>
						<p>Figure D: Slow and fast ferries wheel motion</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						And lastly, there is another way to plot this sine wave motion by
						plotting it against the position versus the angle of the motion from
						the start position instead of time. This angle is called phase which
						is measured in degrees. To conclude, the oscillation of the sine
						wave repeat over and over as the time goes on. It's essentially a
						smooth, repeating up and down motion. It is one of the most
						fundamental and elegant pattern in nature and mathematics.

					<p class="underline">Etymology</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						An interesting tidbit about the etymology of the word sine: it can
						be traced back to Sanskrit mathematic word
						<span class="italic">jīvā</span> or <span class="italic">jyā</span>.
						The arc of a circle is like a bow and so is called a
						<span class="italic">dhanu</span> or
						<span class="italic">chāpa</span> which in Sanskrit means "a bow".
						The straight line joining the arc of a circle is like the string of
						a bow and this line is the chord of the circle. This chord is called
						a <span class="italic">jyā</span> which in Sanskrit means "a bow
						string". This word in turn is a translation of the Greek khordē “gut
						string” (which was borrowed into Latin as chorda and is the source
						of the word chord in English). The Indians borrowed Greek
						trigonometry and translated khordē literally as jyā, but they used
						this word not for a chord but for a half-chord. Indian astronomers
						and mathematicians realised that computations would be more
						convenient if one used the halves of the chords instead of the full
						chords and these half-chords were called
						<span class="italic">ardha-jyā</span> or
						<span class="italic">jyā-ardha</span>. Aryabhata frequently
						abbreviated this term to <span class="italic">jyā</span> or its
						synonym <span class="italic">jiva</span>. The Arabic astronomers
						inherited this Greek and Indian systems of astronomy and the
						Sanskrit word <span class="italic">jyā</span> was transcribed as
						<span class="italic">jīb</span> but Arabic is written without vowels
						and that the word in question is spelt
						<span class="italic">jb</span>. In the twelfth century the
						Arabic-Latin translator Gerard of Cremona from Italy misread the
						letter as <span class="italic">jyab</span> meaning "breast pocket"
						and used the Latin equivalent word
						<span class="italic">sinus</span>. So the word sine is a Greek word
						first translated into Sanskrit, then transcribed into Arabic, and
						then mistranslated into Latin.
					</p>
					<p class="underline">Why sine wave?</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Ok so we've seen what a sine wave is but why do we need a sine wave
						to recreate a sound? Well to answer that let's understand what sound
						is? Sound is a perceived phenomenon resulting from vibrations in our
						surroundings. For any object to make sound it has to
						vibrate/oscillate which will produce a disturbance in the air and
						then that disturbance (air pressure changes) has to reach our ears
						for us to perceive the sound of that object. When objects vibrate
						naturally the resulting air pressure variations follow sinusoidal
						patterns due to the laws of the physics which govern the
						vibration/oscillation. Sine waves is what nature uses to create
						sounds. An 18<sup>th</sup> century French mathematician
						Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier proved mathematically that any periodic
						waveform can be represented as a sum of sine waves. Sine waves are
						the fundamental components that make all sounds. The mathematical
						elegance of sine waves as periodic motion helps us to create any
						existing or new sounds. Not just sounds sine waves show up different
						instances like: the pendulum motion, alternating current, radio
						waves, etc.
					</p>
					<p class="underline">How do I create sounds from a sine wave?</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						You can't create sounds from just a single sine wave. If you play
						the demo below with just one harmonic you'll hear the pure tone of
						440Hz. A sine wave oscillating at 440Hz produces a pure tone which
						doesn't have a lot of properties. In nature a pure sine does not
						exist, it actually has harmonics. You'll never hear a pure sine tone
						of a particular frequency in nature. What differentiates a sine tone
						from a natural sound is harmonics. Harmonics are the additional
						frequencies present in natural sounds. Each sine wave corresponds to
						exactly one frequency which is just one component of the natural
						sound. By combining different sine waves of different frequencies we
						can recreate all naturally occurring sounds.
						<br />
						Let's take a vibrating string on a guitar as an example. If the
						guitar string when plucked os vibrating at 440Hz which is called the
						fundamental frequency, it is not just vibrating at 440Hz but also at
						880Hz, 1200Hz, 1600Hz, 2000Hz, 2400Hz and so on and so forth till
						infinity. But what happens is the energy at the higher frequencies
						is less than the fundamental frequency. The energy at higher
						frequencies follows the formula: 1/n<sup>2</sup> where n is the
						fundamental frequency which means the second harmonic 880Hz has 1/4
						the energy of the fundamental, 1200Hz has 1/9 the energy of the
						fundamental and so on and so forth. You hear the fundamental
						frequency the loudest and the higher harmonics add additional timbre
						to the fundamental frequency which gives each sound its unique
						fingerprint. The reason you can distinguish between a trumpet and a
						flute playing the same note is because both instruments have a
						different distribution of energy on the higher harmonics. Harmonics
						follow a simple integer relation to the fundamental which makes them
						pleasing to our ears. But you also find harmonics that are not in
						this simple relation with the fundamental and such frequencies are
						called inharmonic frequencies. There is another term used for higher
						harmonics in the sound called as overtones. Any higher frequency in
						the sound other than fundamental is called an overtone but only the
						frequencies that are in the simple integer relation to the
						fundamental are called harmonics.
						<span class="underline italic"
							>All harmonics are overtones but not all overtones are
							harmonic.</span
						>
						<br />
						The 3 fundamental sound waves that we use to synthesis sounds is
						triangle, sawtooth, and square waves. These waves can also be
						created using a bunch of sine waves and carefully maintaining the
						energy in each harmonic. Let's see how you can create these
						individual waves from just sine waves.
					</p>
					<p class="underline">Sawtooth wave</p>
					<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Start with a fundamental sine wave frequency at your desired
							frequency: f.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add harmonics at integer multiples of that frequency eg. 2f, 3f,
							4f,...
						</li>
						<li>
							Set each harmonic's amplitude to be inversely proportional to its
							number.
						</li>
						<li>1<sup>st</sup> harmonic (fundamental) amplitude = 1</li>
						<li>2<sup>nd</sup> harmonic amplitude = 1/2</li>
						<li>3<sup>rd</sup> harmonic amplitude = 1/3</li>
						<li>4<sup>th</sup> harmonic amplitude = 1/4</li>
						<li>and so on...</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="underline">Triangle wave</p>
					<ol class="mb-2 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Start with a fundamental sine wave frequency at your desired
							frequency: f.
						</li>
						<li>Add only odd numbered harmonics e.g 3f, 5f, 7f, etc.</li>
						<li>
							Alternate the phase (positive and negative) for each successive
							harmonic.
						</li>
						<li>
							Set each harmonic's amplitude to be inversely proportional to the
							square of its number.
						</li>
						<li>1<sup>st</sup> harmonic (fundamental) amplitude = 1</li>
						<li>3<sup>rd</sup> harmonic amplitude = -1/9</li>
						<li>5<sup>th</sup> harmonic amplitude = 1/25</li>
						<li>7<sup>th</sup> harmonic amplitude = -1/49</li>
						<li>and so on...</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Triangle waves contain only odd harmonics with rapidly decreasing
						amplitudes. This gives them a softer, more mellow sound compared to
						sawtooth waves. The alternating phases (+ and -) are crucial for
						creating the symmetrical triangular shape.
					</p>
					<p class="underline">Square wave</p>
					<ol class="mb-2 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Start with a fundamental sine wave frequency at your desired
							frequency: f.
						</li>
						<li>Add only odd numbered harmonics e.g 3f, 5f, 7f, etc.</li>
						<li>All harmonics are in phase with the fundamental</li>
						<li>
							Set each harmonic's amplitude to be inversely proportional to the
							square of its number.
						</li>
						<li>1<sup>st</sup> harmonic (fundamental) amplitude = 1</li>
						<li>3<sup>rd</sup> harmonic amplitude = -1/9</li>
						<li>5<sup>th</sup> harmonic amplitude = 1/25</li>
						<li>7<sup>th</sup> harmonic amplitude = -1/49</li>
						<li>and so on...</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Square waves contain only odd harmonics with amplitudes that
						decrease more slowly than triangle waves. This gives them their
						characteristic bright, hollow sound with strong higher harmonics.
						The absence of even harmonics creates the symmetrical
						positive/negative pattern of the square wave.

					Important: ok so after playing with the triangle, sawtooth and square
					waves you'll find that they they do not sound like those waves and
					sound more like a sine tone. Well for now all I have is 10 harmonics
					which is not enough to make it sound like for example a triangle wave
					even though the waveform might look like one. To correctly model the
					sonic properties of these waves we need to have at least 20-30
					harmonics minimum. Adding individual harmonics to create new sounds is
					called additive synthesis so maybe I could actually work on making a
					synthesiser which does that but making a synthesiser as a web app with
					JS? No Sir! Maybe WASM and JS will make up for interesting project.
					<br />
					Anyway just play around with the sliders for now.
