						Not all vibrations that produce sound are intelligible or pleasing
						to the ear. We hear sounds around us all the time yet most of it is
						not really pleasing to the ear as compared to hearing musical sound.
						Why is that? the sound of music (organised sound) or tone has
						regular vibrations while noise (not organised) has irregular pattern
						of vibrations. नाद (Nāda) is the musical sound in the Indian
						classical music but also has spiritual and philosophical
						connotations. The reason why music sounds pleasing but not noise is
						due to Math. Human brains are pattern finding machines. Our brains
						evolved to reward us for the simple frequency ratios likely due to
						survival mechanism to detect regular non-threatening patterns in the
						environment. But sometimes we apply the same preference for
						mathematical symmetry and consonance into the realm of music for
						purely aesthetic purposes. The pleasure we derive from harmonic
						sounds is an example of taking an adaptive trait (pattern
						recognition) and redirecting it towards non-essential, cultural
						pursuits like music composition and appreciation. There is a popular
						theory is that music is a spandrel of language.

					<p class="text-lg underline">Musical notes and consonance:</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						Music judges two individual notes only by their mutual relations.
						Consonance is the perceived pleasantness to the certain musical
						relations. It refers to the phenomenon of identifying one note or
						pitch being related to or in harmony to each other. Consonant
						intervals have a high degree of frequency matching which creates a
						smooth and a stable sound. Two tones with lower frequency matching
						results to dissonance which is not pleasant to the ears. The
						mismatch in the frequencies is what gives them their unstable
						quality. The ratio of the matching frequencies must be as close to a
						whole number. Our brains are less attuned to perceiving the
						dissonant frequencies as pleasant.
						<br />
						From mathematical perspective simple frequency ratios like 2:1 for
						an octave create more overlapping peaks in the sound waves resulting
						in less [interference] and more stable vibration patterns. In a 2:1
						octave ratio every 2 vibrations of the higher note and 1 vibration
						of the lower note align regularly. This creates less [beating] or
						interference between the frequencies. More complex ratios like 16:15
						align less frequently and create more complex patterns that our
						auditory system finds as rough or instable - what we perceive as
						dissonance. Consonance is a matter of degree than absolutes as some
						sounds have a greater degree of matching than others. Unison or the
						perfect identities in music occur if both the notes (sounds) have
						the same frequency or the frequency of the second note is a multiple
						of the reference note. The second note is an octave to the reference
						note. However, there are notes other than octaves that have some
						degree of identity with the reference note. Ancient civilisations of
						Egypt, Greece, China, India, etc. knew about this relationship and
						used them in their musical systems.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Consonance occurs when waves of sound created by two notes combine
						with each other or oppose each other. If they oppose each other
						something called <span class="italic">beats</span> which cause
						disturbance of uneven nature. The number of beats is the difference
						between thr frequencies of the two notes. Low beats are not
						disturbing to the ear, as the difference increases do does the
						disturbance until it reaches a maximum point after which it
						decreases with the beat now as a secondary note which is in
						consonance with the original note. Sounds produced by the voice or
						other sources like stretched strings they contain besides their
						fundamental frequency or ptime note the overtones or harmonic upper
						partials. The overtones have a simple relationship with the
						fundamental frequency or note. Hence they do bot generate any beats
						and gives a note that blends with the fundamental note enriching its
						quality or the tonal colour <span class="italic">timbre</span>.

					<p class="mb-10">
						Consonance is of varying degrees and can range from perfect
						consonance to imperfect consonance. If two notes are not consonance
						in simple ratios to each other like an octave but are related
						through a third note which is then the common root the consonance is
						perfect but not absolute and is of the second order.
						<br />
						To sum it up, the more direct the relationship between two notes the
						greater the consonance and the relationship can range from absolute
						consonance to perfect dissonance with degrees such as perfect
						consonance, imperfect consonance and imperfect dissonance lying in
						between.
						<br />
						<br />
						Having only two notes from an octave which has a perfect consonance
						creates a large gap between the two notes but also it's no possible
						to use just these two notes to create music. Hence we need to
						introduce more notes in the system and make a scale to facilitate
						musical compositions and this is where the varying degree of
						consonance comes in picture. How to use the varying degree of
						consonance to make most of the notes consonant with each other is a
						fascinating mathematical problem. Greek philosopher and
						mathematician [Pythagoras] too tried to solve this problem. This
						scale can be constructed into many unique ways and hence each
						culture has its own unique sound because each had their own musical
						scale built between the two octaves. However, broadly speaking there
						are two types of musical systems based on whether melody or harmony
						pre-dominates the music.
						<span class="underline">
							In melodic musical systems the appeal and the emotion is conveyed
							through a succession of notes in relation to each other based on a
							fundamental frequency. In harmonic musical systems it is the
							relationship between different notes simultaneously played which
							is of importance. The sequential relationship matters here. Sound
							is temporal. Sound occurs over time, its properties are perceived
							and experienced as a series of changes that unfold in time. Sound
							has a beginning and an end. The duration of the sound is one of
							its key temporal aspects. Each note has a time value, the period
							over which it is sounded and this time value need not be absolute
							but rather relative to the entire piece as the whole piece can be
							speeded up or down.
						</span>
						<br />
						Another thing that arises out of the regular strong and weak accents
						or pulsations in a piece of music which is referred to as
						<span class="italic">meter</span>. Each pulsation either strong or
						weak is called a beat. The duration of a note refers to the length
						of the sound in terms of time as measured by the number of beats.
						The beats are in a group of 2 or 3 and are arranged into a uniform
						measure. Time is an extremely important aspect of music and appears
						as the regular reoccurrence of strong and weak pulsations known as
						meter and as a result of arrangements of various note length
						referred to as the rhythm. This is the basis of time and rhythmical
						structuring in music in general.

					</ul>
					<p class="underline mb-5">The production of natural sounds:</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						When a string is plucked it will vibrate over the whole length of
						the string. At the same time the string vibrates over fractional
						divisions of its length (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, etc.) producing a
						series of harmonics (overtones) whose frequencies are inversely
						proportional (2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, etc., where x is the fundamental
						frequency of the string) to those fractional divisions.
						Theoretically an infinite number of these multiple modes of
						vibration exist, each mode producing its own harmonic. As one
						ascends the series, the amplitude, or loudness of each harmonic
						tends to diminish, so the higher modes produce harmonics that are
						usually too soft for us to hear.
						<br />
						In other words, when a string is plucked, it vibrates over its
						entire length, which is 1, and produces a fundamental tone. This
						tone is the loudest and the one you tend to hear. However, at the
						same time, the same string also divides itself into two equal parts,
						1/2, and they vibrate at the same frequency which is twice that of
						the fundamental frequency. This frequency is not as loud as that of
						the fundamental, but your brain still picks up on it. At the same
						time, the string also divides itself into three equal parts, 1/3,
						and they vibrate at the same frequency which is three times that of
						the fundamental. This frequency is even softer than that of the 2nd
						harmonic, but your brain will still pick up on it. The string keeps
						dividing itself in this harmonic pattern over and over again
						creating an unending amount of frequencies. Since they get softer
						and softer they eventually become negligible to the ear.

						When a string is pluck it starts to vibrates in its full length and

						<p>
							The logarithmic sound is more evenly spaced than the linear sound.
							There is another interesting feature of the human ears:
							<span class="underline"
								>increased sensitivity of of certain frequencies.</span
							>
							Human ears are more sensitive to frequencies around
							<span class="italic">2000Hz-5000Hz</span>. The ear canal behaves
							like a resonator of and its resonance is around 3000Hz. The
							tympanic membrane and the ossicles also respond efficiently to the
							frequencies around this range. The 2000Hz-5000Hz range is also
							crucial for speech. Many important consonant sounds in human
							speech such as s, sh, t, and f, lie in this frequency band. The
							human ear is naturally tuned to be most sensitive to these
							frequencies because they are vital for understanding speech.
							<br />
							A breakdown of consonant sounds and their typical frequency
							ranges:
						</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
							<li>Fricatives (f, s, sh, v, z): 3-7 kHz</li>
							<li>
								Plosives (p, t, k, b, d, g): High-frequency bursts around 4-8
								kHz
							</li>
							<li>Affricates (ch, j): Similar to plosives, around 4-7 kHz</li>
							<li>Nasals (m, n, ng): Lower frequencies, mostly below 3 kHz</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This means that sound around these frequencies are perceived
							louder than even if their sound pressure level [more on this
							modular synth] is the same. The difference in frequency
							sensitivity actually depends on sound levels. We hear mid-range
							frequencies (around 3-4 kHz) most clearly.
							<br />
							The ear perceives higher harmonics in relation to the fundamental
							frequency. Harmonic tones contain multiple frequency components
							but the brain perceives it has a coherent whole where the main
							pitch is of the fundamental frequency. The auditory system tends
							to group or bind components that are harmonically related. The
							harmonics evoke a pitch that is related to the fundamental
							frequency of the complex tone. Interestingly, this
							<span class="italic">virtual pitch</span> is perceived even when
							the energy at the fundamental frequency of the complex tone is
							absent or masked or hidden. The brain is so attuned to the
							harmonic series that if we hear a sound that has all the
							components except the fundamental frequency the brain fills it for
							us. This phenomenon is called
							<span class="italic">restoration of the missing fundamental</span
							>. A sound energy consisting of frequencies 100Hz, 200Hz, 300Hz,
							400Hz, etc. is perceived as having a pitch of 100Hz. We don't
							perceive it as having a pitch of 200Hz because our brains know
							that a normal harmonic sound with a pitch of 200Hz would have
							frequency components 400Hz, 600Hz, 800Hz, etc. in its harmonic
							series. The brain is extremely attuned to the harmonic structure
							of sound. It understands that the harmonic series is built with
							fundamental frequencies and overtones frequencies as a multiple of
							the fundamental frequency. The brain uses the harmonic series to
							deduct the pitch of the sound along with the fundamental
							frequency. When it hears 200Hz, 300Hz, 400Hz, 500Hz it knows that
							100Hz fits in the relationship of the harmonics of the sound since
							the ears are logarithmic and vibrating sound (eg. vibrating
							string) vibrates along its full length with multiple vibrations at
							the same time. So this tells us that pitch perception is not
							always based on the fundamental frequency, the brain uses the
							overtones too. Small speakers may not be able to produce the lower
							frequencies like 100Hz but our brains can still "hear" the pitch.
							Petr Janata a graduate student in biology in 1996 for his
							dissertation conducted a really interesting experiment on barn
							owls. He placed electrodes in the inferior colliculus [more on
							this later] of the barn owl which is a part of auditory system.
							Then he played the owls a version of Staruss'
							<a
								href="https://youtu.be/_CTYymbbEL4?si=UrJFJuxb9rZ0y9NL"
								target="_blank"
								class="text-accent-color"
								>"The Blue Danube Waltz"</a
							>
							made up of tones from which the fundamental frequency had been
							removed. He hypothesised that if the missing fundamental is
							restored at early levels of auditory processing, neurons in the
							owl's inferior colliculus should fire at the rate of the missing
							fundamental frequency and this is exactly what he found. The
							electrodes put out a small electrical signal with each firing and
							since the firing rate is same as frequency of firing, when Petr
							sent the output of these electrodes to a small amplifier, played
							back the sound of owl's neurons through a loudspeaker he could
							literally hear the melody of The Blue Danube Waltz clearly from
							the speakers.
							<span class="underline"
								>The firing rate of neurons were identical to the frequency of

						question: if the human ears are logarithmic and for eg. when the
						ears hear a sound with frequency 500Hz how does the brain map the
						frequency to an interval with the fundamental frequency of let's say
						100Hz? [need more research on how the brain works with harmonics in
						the sound]
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						The lower frequencies are individually identified by the brain and
						their spacing is calculated to extract the pitch of sound [need
						research on this]. The human brain is a pattern finding machine
						which extracts the most common relationship (interval) between each
						of the frequency component in the harmonic series. Even if the
						lowest frequency is missing the brain can calculate that frequency
						because of the consistent relationship between the other set of
						frequencies in the series. The sounds created which are in multiple
						proportions to the fundamental frequency or Shadaj (100, 200, 300,
						400, 500) are called
						<span class="italic">harmonics</span> because they are in harmony
						with Shadaj. They sound pleasant to our ears. Pancham (3rd harmonic)
						and Gandhar (5th harmonic) are most pleasant. Tanpura a drone
						instrument creates an atmosphere of dominant Shadaj-Gāndhār-Pancham.
						<br />
						When the source of the sound vibrates again and again different
						harmonics/partials mix and this mixture has a particular quality.
						This is the timbre or <span class="italic">नादगुण (Nādaguṇa)</span>.
						The harmonics of string instruments which have long strings like the
						Violin and Sarangi have a harmonic profile similar to that of human
						voice and hence are considered as best for accompaniment to human
						singing.

						The pentatonic scale: [needs its own article]
					</p>
					<p class="mb-2">
						The interval (relationship) 3:2 known as the fifth is a consonant
						interval. Known as षड्ज पंचम भाव (Shadaj Pancham Bhāva) in Indian
						music theory and is the basis of the music scale. This primitive
						scale was based on octave and fifth intervals having the ratio 1:2
						and 3:2 respectively, both of which were known to ancient people.
						<br />
						Let's take the base frequency as f and its octave as F. If we add
						another note as fifth of the base frequency we end up with
						<span class="italic">f C F</span>. These notes are still not enough
						for a scale so let's add another perfect fifth note of C that is G
						and C octave C'. The resultant scale now is
						<span class="italic">f C F G C'</span>. Now D is the fifth of g
						which is an octave below G, one of the consonant notes in the scale
						derived above, including this we have
						<span class="italic">f C D F G C'</span>. Once again A' is the fifth
						of D we arrive at the scale C D F G A', the notes arranged in the
						ascending order.
					</p>

					<p class="mb-5">
						This is called the <span class="italic">pentatonic scale</span> of
						ancient music you might see in Chinese and African musical systems.
						If we keep adding notes to an octave with fifth as the basis for the
						new notes we'll reach to a scale starting which would look like this
						if started with C: <span class="italic">C D E F G A B</span> also
						known as scale of C in Western musical systems. This is the scale
						[Pythagoras] explained both musically and mathematically. Although
						named after him in the West the scale was being used by ancient
						civilisations in Asia. The pentatonic scale, as a five-note scale,
						is foundational to many ancient musical traditions across different
						cultures, and it can be traced back to even earlier than the time of
						Pythagoras. Early forms of the pentatonic scale appear in the music
						of ancient Mesopotamia. Archaeological evidence, such as Babylonian
						cuneiform tablets, suggests that the early Mesopotamians used a
						five-note scale in their music. The Hurrian songs (or Hurrian Hymns)
						are a collection of music inscribed in cuneiform on clay tablets
						excavated from the ancient Amorite-Canaanite city of Ugarit, a
						headland in northern Syria, which date to approximately 1400 BCE.
						One of these tablets which is nearly complete contains the Hurrian
						Hymn to Nikkal (also known as the Hurrian cult hymn or a
						zaluzi-prayer to the gods), making it the oldest surviving
						substantially complete work of notated music in the world. In
						ancient Chinese music, the pentatonic scale was used in the
						"Gongche" notation system. The traditional Chinese pentatonic scale
						is built on five notes, and it has been a central element of Chinese
						music theory for thousands of years. Various African music
						traditions use pentatonic scales, particularly in sub-Saharan music.
						The use of the pentatonic scale in Indian music is not only a
						technical element of राग संगीत (Rāga Saṅgīta) but also has deep
						cultural and emotional significance. The five-note structure often
						evokes specific emotional states known as रस (Rasa - "essence",
						"flavor", or "emotion") and moods, which are central to the Indian
						music aesthetic.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						The seven notes in Pythagorean scale were used in Greek music and
						formed the basis of 6 modes which were adopted by medieval European
						music. Out of the 6, 2 were adopted by Western music in the 17<sup
							>th</sup
						>
						century and now are called as <span class="italic">Major</span> and
						<span class="italic">Minor</span> scales. The scale that Indian
						classical music adopted is the diatonic scale. The prefix "dia-" in
						"diatonic" comes from the Greek word "διά" (dia), which means
						"through" or "across". In the case of "diatonic", it refers to a
						scale or system that spans across or through a full octave using a
						series of specific intervals, typically of whole and half steps. In
						Indian classical music, the concept of a diatonic scale is not as
						explicitly defined as it is in Western music.
