					One of the most fundamental variables that organisms have to quantify
					in order to survive is temporality or time. Our brains have to develop
					a sense of time to do activities like talk, sing, run, perform
					activities in a group, drive, etc. On a scale with microseconds on one
					side and circadian rhythm on the other temporal information guides our
					behaviour. A 12 order magnitude is covered by this scale.

				<p class="underline">Microsecond Scale</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Information processing in the microseconds is needed for binaural
					hearing and echolocation. For binaural hearing the microsecond scale
					is used by the auditory system to determine the differences in time in
					the action potentials for the two ears called as
					<span class="italic">interaural delay</span> to determine the spatial
					origin of the sound. The sound will arrive slightly earlier for the
					near ear usually in the order of 600-700&mu;s because of the natural
					interaural time difference (ITD).
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Milliseconds Range</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Intercal timing ranging from 200-1000ms involves a broad spectrum of
					activities ranging from collision avoidance, object interception,
					speech perception, motion processing, execution and processing music,
					coordinating fine movements, etc. The temporal processing in this
					range is quite sophisticated yet poorly understood on how the neural
					processing works to make it happen.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Seconds to Minute Scale</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Temporal processing in this range depends on conscious and cognitive
					control and is involved in foraging, decision making, sequential motor
					performance, arithmetic, associative learning, etc. Timing in this
					scale forms the contextual framework through which our behaviour is
					mapped onto the external world.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Circadian Rhythms</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					The biological timing that organises the daily environmental
					oscillations every 24 hours is known as the circadian clock. The two
					major functions of this clock are:
					<br />
					- Prepare your body for what's coming next based on the time of day.
					It optimises the temporal manifestations of different biological
					activities during the day by anticipating of recurring fluctuations in
					the environment.
					<br />
					- Prevent biological conflicts by timing different processes to not
					interfere with each other. Eg. release growth hormones only while
					sleeping and not during the day when you need energy for activities.
					<br />
					The circadian rhythm in mammals is governed by a complex network of
					<span class="italic">cellular molecular oscillators</span> distributed
					throughout the brain and peripheral tissues. The master clock is in
					the brain in this region known as
					<span class="italic">hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei</span> (SCN).
				</p>
				<div class="flex justify-center my-10">

				</div>
				<p class="mb-5">
					It synchronises the internal clock with the external light-dark cycle
					of the day. The internal circadian clock in mammals possesses a rhythm
					with an approximate 24 hour period and the synchronising signal is
					light. The SCN acts as a relay between the external light-dark cycle
					and the internal timing system. So, the peripheral clocks are governed
					directly by the SCN that controls the activities like feeding, body
					temperature, hormone release, etc.

					Different timing mechanism for different timing behaviours?
				</p>
				<p>
					The word <span class="italic">timing</span> can have the connotation
					of either <span class="italic">how long</span> an event lasts or
					<span class="italic">when</span> an event occurs. So, the internal
					clocks should have the ability to encode the elapsed time from a
					stimulus or process such as the time between the notes in a song,
					along with the capacity to measure remaining time for an action where
					the system should select a precise moment for doing something for an
					accurate result like when a batsman hits a cricket ball.
					<br />
					Our brains need to compute time from different modalities of sensory
					stimulus or when involved in rhythmic activities like music and
					dancing or when marking the elapsed time from an event or as the time
					remaining for an action. So, some key elements of temporal processing
					include the time scale being quantified, the modality of the stimuli
					guiding the time perception, whether the time is being measured for a
					movement or perceptual decision, whether the task involves single or
					multiple intervals, whether the timing generated is external or
					internal.

				</div>
				<p>
					Currently we have two opposite models how these different timing
					stimuli are processed in the brain. The hypothesis of the first model
					is that there is a common mechanism that processes temporal
					information across all the behaviours. This hypothesis is supported by
					classical psychophysical (a branch of psychology that studies relation
					between physical stimuli and mental phenomena) observations eg.
					perception and motor production share common timing mechanisms and by
					brain lesion and functional imaging studies. On the other hand the
					hypothesis from the opposing model says the temporal processing is
					ubiquitous and localised depending on the behavioural context. It
					suggests that time processing does not have a dedicated parts in the
					brain but rather a property that emerges from the normal functioning
					of whatever brain networks are involved in the task. This view is
					supported by modeling, brain slice recordings, and new psychophysical
					approaches. There is an emerging third view which suggests the
					existence of partially distributed timing mechanism, integrated by
					main core structures of the cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia circuit and
					the areas of the brain that are selectively engaged in the behavioural
					task and is supported via recent psychophysical studies and functional
					imaging meta analysis.

					The psychophysics of temporal quantification started as early as the
					late 19<sup>th</sup> century. While the study o the neural basis of
					timing is quite recent so there is still not enough evidence to accept
					or refute any of the hypotheses mentioned above.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Sensory Timing</p>
				<p>
					All organisms extract temporal information from stimuli of all sensory
					channels even if there is no time sensory organ. We are still not sure
					how time is computed from the activation of different sensory systems
					nor where is the temporal information extracted in this hierarchy of
					sensory systems. But let's first understand the the general functional
					arrangement of the auditory, visual and somatosensory (relating to a
					sensation such as pressure, pain, or warmth which can happen anywhere
					in the body) systems that are involved in the temporal processing
					particularly in the hundreds of milliseconds range. These sensory
					systems have the following commonalities: the sensory trigger of a
					signal of the physical information into action potentials in the
					sensory receptor; the projection of this information through the
					thalamus to the primary sensory areas of the cerebral cortex; the
					processing of the different aspects of the stimuli in the cortical
					circuits of the brain; and finally the use of high order sensory
					processing for perception, learning, memory and voluntary motor
					action. Initially, time information could be extracted from the
					trigger of the signal of the sensory input in the first relays of the
					sensory systems involved. Not just that various studies show that
					auditory modality has the strongest ability to extract temporal
					information in the range of tens of milliseconds across the first
					relays of the sensory processing which tells us that time is a
					fundamental behavioural parameter for audition.
					<br />
					For vision, duration tuned cells show up in the first nodes of the
					visual pathway. Some of the neurons respond best to stimuli that last
					a specific amount of time. The time range is between 50 to 400
					milliseconds. Interestingly, no such tuned cells were found in thr
					thalamus for visual processing which suggests that time processing in
					visual stimuli is localised in the first relays of neurons. However,
					research has shown that temporal processing observed psychophysical
					tasks in humans is more precise and accurate when the intervals are
					defined by auditory than visual or tactile stimuli.
					<br />
					Another important property of temporal processing is that the
					perceived time is affected by whether the intervals in the stimuli are
					empty or filled. For auditory input empty stimuli could look like:
					click - silence - click. For visual stimuli it could look like flicker
					- darkness - flicker. The filled stimuli for auditory stimulus could
					be a stream of noise or tone and for visual it could be just a flash
					for the whole interval. Studies have shown that intervals with filled
					stimuli feel longer than the stimuli with empty intervals. No single
					mechanism fully explains the effect, it is the result of fundamental
					differences in how the brain processes temporal information when
					additional sensory processing is required versus when timing can
					operate in isolation.
					<br />
					The temporal processing hence seems to be dependent on a specialised
					group of cells in the early nodes of the sensory processing that are
					tuned to the duration of auditory or visual stimuli.
