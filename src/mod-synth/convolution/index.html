					Let's talk systems. You hear people talk about systems and how complex
					some systems are. Systems surround us in every aspect if life. Think
					about economy, it consists of entities interacting with each other and
					producing some output i.e. economic activity which affects all our
					lives. It consists of consumers, businesses, governments, and
					resources interacting through countless transactions. A car is a
					system which consists of smaller systems interacting with each other
					and producing not just one but multiple outputs. It integrates
					mechanical, electrical, and computational subsystems that collectively
					provide transportation. For example when you press the car pedal these
					interacting smaller systems produce velocity which moves the car. In
					terms of audio processing a filter is a system which takes in an input
					and filters out a part of that given output. You'd not want your
					filter to be unstable and modify the input signal in an inconsistent
					manner. So how do you make sure when designing such systems that they
					produce the same output given the same input now or later. The
					challenge across all these domains is ensuring consistency and
					predictability that a system will behave the same way given the same
					inputs regardless of when or how it's operated.
					<br />
					A <span class="italic">system</span> can be defined as a set of
					interconnected components that work together to achieve specific
					outcomes. In terms of DSP a system can be defined as any process that
					produces an output signal in response to an input signal. A
					<span class="italic">signal</span> describes how one parameter varies
					with another parameter. For example an analog signal in DSP is voltage
					changing over time. Systems and signals can be discrete or continuous.
					Mathematically continuous signals use parentheses: x(t), y(t) while
					discrete signals use brackets: x[t], y[t]. Also, signals use lowercase
					letters. The name given to a signal usually describes the parameters
					of the signal, eg. v(t) is voltage over time.
				</p>
				<p class="underline mb-2">System Properties</p>
				<p>
					Let's take the car pedal as an example. The pressure you apply to the
					pedal translates to the velocity produced by the system. So, p(t) ->
					system -> v(t) i.e. velocity. Or let's take a different kind of system
					as example which is outside the engineering domain such as price of
					petrol on a day. The price of a barrel of oil which goes into a system
					like economy and what you get is the price of a litre of petrol. o[n]
					-> system -> p[n]. Mathematically a system is denoted by H so p[n] =
					H(o[n]). In real life there is seldom a simple system consisting of
					just one unit, usually multiple subsystems are connected to each other
					in serial, parallel feedback fashion. A cruise control in cars is a
					good example of a feedback system.

					Such systems have certain properties that we need to understand in
					order to study them and first one of the properties is
					<span class="italic">causality</span>. A system is causal if the
					output at time n only depends on the input up to time n.
					<br />
					y[n] = x[n] - 3x[n-1]
					<br />
					This system seems causal and to check if it causal or not we can check
					if the output depends on a future value. For eg.
					<br />
					y[n] = x[n+2] is not causal as it depends on a future value that we
					don't have yet.
					<br />
					This one sounds to be pretty obvious. Your car doesn't know how you're
					going to interact with it. The car will only react when you interact
					with it making it a causal system. But we also see many non-causal
					systems in real life. Systems in pattern recognition, image
					processing, etc. are non-causal. If you want to blur a part of the
					image you take all the surrounding pixel and average it out to
					pixelate that part. If this was causal you'd only be allowed to access
					pixels up to that part of the image and not the later ones for
					averaging it out. A system being causal or not depends entirely on the
					type of signal it's processing.
					<br />
					Studying systems is very crucial for DSP. For example, when you speak
					on a phone you want your voice to resemble you on the other side. But
					the input on the transmission line is different from the output on the
					other side so in this case if you understand how the transmission line
					(the system) works you can compensate for the unwanted effects on the
					output signal. But where do we start this study? There are so many
					systems out there in the world so it can take a lot of effort studying
					each and every system. Well luckily given we are bound by physical
					laws we can categorise such systems because of their intended
					behaviour into something called as
					<span class="italic">linear systems</span> which makes it easier
					studying them. Linearity is the second property of systems. Let's
					understand this property in detail.
				</p>
				<p class="underline mb-2">Linearity</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					A system is linear if it satisfies these two mathematical properties:
					<span class="italic">homogeneity</span> and
					<span class="italic">additivity</span>. There is another property
					called
					<span class="italic">shift invariance / time invariance</span> which
					is not a requirement for linearity but is a must for DSP domain. Let's
					understand all 3 of these properties.
					<br />
					A system is homogeneous if change in the amplitude of the input
					results in corresponding change in the amplitude of the output signal.
					So if you multiply the input with a value to scale it the output
					should also be scaled by that value. A resistor is a good example of a
					homogeneous system. Any change in voltage v(t) across the resistor
					will result in change of the current flowing through the resistor and
					Ohm's law guarantees this. But if you think about it resistor is also
					a non-homogeneous system if you look at the power dissipated by the
					resistor. Since power is square of the voltage any change in the
					voltage produces the power by a factor of 4 since p &prop;
					v<sup>2</sup>.
					<br />
					<br />
					Let's say you have an input x<sub>1</sub>[n] which goes through a
					system and gives y<sub>1</sub>[n]. Now you take another signal
					x<sub>2</sub>[n] which gives an output of y<sub>2</sub>[n]. A system
					is additive if the sum of the inputs produces sum of those individual
					outputs. What this means is that the signals should pass through the
					system without interacting. Think of this, when you're on a conference
					call you can hear each person's voice as theirs if they are all
					talking at the same time, you don't hear a new kind of voice which is
					an amalgamation of the individual voices coming through the phone.
					Both of the properties can be described in the following manner:
					<br />
					ax<sub>1</sub>[n] + bx<sub>2</sub>[n] -> system -> ay<sub>1</sub>[n] +
					by<sub>2</sub>[n]
					<br />
					for any input x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>.
					<br />
					<br />
					Shift or time invariance says the system behaves the same way
					regardless of when the input is applied. A shift in the input signal
					will result in the an identical shift in the output signal. If we add
					a delay the signal by some value the output should also be delayed by
					the same value.
					<br />
					x[n-n<sub>0</sub>] -> system -> y[n-n<sub>0</sub>]
					<br />
					<br />
					Not all systems are time invariant. For example, the speed to download
					a file at 3am is not the same as speed of download at 3pm. Internet
					traffic is non time invariant. So why is additivity and homogeneity a
					requirement for linearity but not time invariance? This is because
					linearity is pretty broad and sometimes does not involve a signal. For
					example, consider a shopkeeper who sells oranges for $2 per crate and
					mangoes for $5 per crate. If the shopkeeper only sells oranges they
					will receive $10 for 5 creates and $20 for 10 crates which makes the
					exchange homogeneous. If they sell 20 creates of oranges and 10
					creates of mangoes they will get $2 x 20 + $5 x 10 = $90 which is the
					same amount as if thw two had been solved individually making the
					transaction additive. The transaction being both additive and
					homogeneous makes it a linear process but since there are no signals
					time invariance need not be satisfied for the process to be linear.
				</p>
				<p class="underline mb-2">Superposition of LTI systems</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Real world systems are modeled as Linear Time Invariant systems as
					LTIs are often a good approximation and analysis is easy and powerful
					of the corresponding real life system. When dealing with linear
					systems the only way the signals can be combined is by
					<span class="italic">scaling</span> which is multiplying tje signal
					with a constant followed by <span class="italic">addition</span>.
					<span class="underline italic"
						>A signal can't be multiplied by another signal.</span
					>
					Combining the signal through scaling and adding is called
					<span class="italic">synthesis</span>. The inverse operation is called
					<span class="italic">decomposition</span>.
