						I am working on a new project at my company which is a fairly simple
						piece of work. We are working on creating a new journey which allows
						users to avail a regional promotional offer based on the criteria
						that their postcode is eligible for that regional offer. However,
						working on this simple journey I came across this very weird bug
						which made me question my understanding of how scope and closures
						work in Javascript and pushed me down a rabbit hole to explore and
						fill gaps in my understanding of the said concepts.
						<br />
						Here I am documenting my research into the workings on scope and
						closure in JS and how I was able to fix the peculiar bug in a very
						large React application codebase. Let's start with the basics.
					</p>
					<p class="text-xl">What is scope?</p>
					<p class="mb-3">
						When writing programs in JS we use variables to store values and
						refer to them in our program and do all sorts of things with those
						variables and values. But have you wondered how does JS know which
						variables are accessible at what times and what to do if there are
						variables with the same name in a program?
						<span class="italic">Scope</span> answers these question for JS.
						<br />
						Let's first understand how a JS engine processes our program.
					</p>
					<p class="underline">Compiled vs Interpreted</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Code compilation is the process of transforming the human readable
						code to turn it into a list of instructions a computer can
						understand. When we write code we are working with highly abstracted
						representation of computer operations that is designed to be
						readable and understandable by humans. However, computers only
						understand binary instructions i.e. a sequence of 0s and 1s. This
						creates a gap between how humans write instructions and how
						computers need to receive the said instructions. The compiler serves
						as a mediator here in this process acting as a translator by
						converting human readable code to
						<span class="italic">machine code</span> that computers can directly
						execute. This compilation process is essential because it allows
						programmers to write code at a higher level of abstraction while
						ensuring the computer can still understand and run the program
						correctly. Typically, the whole source is compiled at once and the
						compiled code is stored in a file that can be executed later.
						<br />
						So what is an interpreter?
						<br />
						Think of writing a program like writing a recipe in English that
						needs to be converted into instructions a computer can understand.
						Compilation as a process takes your complete recipe, translates it
						all at once into a new language i.e. the machine code and gives you
						back an executable file that you can use later. When you run the
						executable you are using this translated version of the program
						which is why typically compiled languages run faster. Languages like
						C++, Rust, etc. use compilation. Interpreter on the other hand is
						like having a translator next to you reading and executing each
						instruction one at time a time as you cook. It takes your source
						code and executes it directly, translating and running each line as
						it goes. Javascript, Python, etc. use interpreters.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's take a step back and look at how compilation actually works?
						<br />
						In compilation the program goes through the following sequence:
					</p>
					<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Tokenising: Break up the strings of characters in meaningful
							chunks called tokens.
							<br />
							For eg.
							<span class="italic">const pi = 3.14;</span>
							<br />
							This would be broken into following tokens: const, pi, = , 3.14,
							and ;
						</li>
						<li>
							Parsing: Take a stream of tokens and turn it into a tree of nested
							elements which represent the programs grammar. This is called
							<span class="italic">Abstract Syntax Tree</span>.
							<br />
							For the above example the tree will start with a top node called
							<span class="italic">VariableDeclaration</span> with a child node
							called <span class="italic">Identifier</span> whose value is pi
							and another child called
							<span class="italic">AssignmentExpression</span> which has its own
							child node called <span class="italic">NumericLiteral</span> whose
							value is 3.14.
						</li>
						<li>
							Code generation: Take an AST and turn it into executable code.
							This part varies depending on the language, platform, etc.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Modern JS engine takes the AST and turn it into a set of machine
						instructions to create a variable called pi and then store a value
						3.14 into pi. The engines are not so simple though and have a few
						more steps where they optimise the code execution among other
						things.
						<br />
						But hold that thought! Isn't JS an interpreted language? So how come
						the JS engines first use the compilation step of preparing an AST
						and then use the AST to execute the given piece of code?
						<br />
						Well when Brendan Eich created JS in 1996, the very first JS engine
						he created was called Spider Monkey which is still used in Mozilla
						Firefox. Eich created JS with browsers in mind so any file sent from
						the server could be interpreted quickly and rendered on the browser.
						But as JS got popular and started web became massive performance
						became a key issue.
