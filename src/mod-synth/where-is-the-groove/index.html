					A couple of months ago I went to this "bush techno" gig in a hidden
					warehouse. To my surprise, my friends and I left in 30 minutes after
					reaching to the venue. The music was decent but no matter how much I
					tried I could not move my body to it and honestly I could not explain
					why moving my body to it was so hard. I am not a dancer and have only
					recently started to go out to gigs for dancing. I am a massive techno
					fan because so far in my experience of listening to different
					sounds/music genres techno and house are the only two genres to which
					I can move my body to. After attending a variety of events with
					different genres I realised I can't really move my body to anything
					else than house/techno. I still listen to a lot of other
					"non-dancable" genres but if I am going out for a dancing I only
					attend house/techno events. The only thing I could say about the music
					in the warehouse to my friends was
					<span class="italic">"It's not groovy"</span>. The whole experience
					made me think about groove and what exactly does it mean when someone
					says <span class="italic">"the music is groovy"</span>? Where does
					groove come from? Is there a way to measure groove in music? What
					makes something groovy and something else not so groovy? How does it
					differ from rhythm? Well let's dig in and see if we can find answers
					to these questions I have.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">What is groove?</p>
				<p>
					Humans have an inclination to move with music. Be it subtle foot taps
					and head nods or with full on dance moves we feel this urge to somehow
					sync to the music we are listening to. Steve Gadd one of the best
					known drummers in Jazz says about groove
				</p>
				<blockquote class="p-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-accent-color bg-white">
					<p class="text-base italic font-medium leading-relaxed">
						I've found over the years that the feel overcomes everything. If you
						get a good groove happening, that carries it along. If it feels
						good, there's not a lot you have to do. You can pick and choose your
						spots to dynamically respond to what's going on, but you don't have
						to technically, constantly challenge yourself to fill in those
						spaces.

					How should we define the term <span class="italic">"groove"</span>?
					The word has been in the vocabulary of musicians in popular music for
					a number of decades but has only recently been introduced in the
					theoretical realm where it remains subjected to a variety of
					interpretations. Well let's try to get some theoretical definitions
					out of the way. Groove as a musical quality is an important part of
					genres like Jazz, Hip Hop, modern Pop and dance music. It is an aspect
					of the music that compels us to move and that this feeling is
					generally regarded as pleasurable. So we get some idea of what groove
					means here.
					<br />
					> Groove is a feeling that makes you move your body to music. We feel
					the groove in our bodies.
					<br />
					> Groove is often called the "feel of music".
					<br />
					> Groove can loosely be called "the feel of a rhythm".
					<br />
					> Groove makes us want to move some part of the body in relation to
					some aspect of the sound pattern.
					<br />
					> Groove is principally a property internal to music itself and arises
					from collected effects of various forms of musical nuances especially
					in regards to microtiming.
					<br />
					> In music theory groove refers to the rhythmic properties of pieces
					of music and/or the timing relationships of actions of individuals
					interacting with the music.
					<br />
					> From the musicians' perspective groove is commonly referred to a
					pleasing state in which the creation of music becomes seemingly
					effortless. When playing in a group the groove may be experienced when
					the interaction between the instruments becomes seamless and the music
					feels right subjectively. Or they could say that it is related to the
					rhythmic feel of a piece of music, how the individual parts or layers
					of the music interlock and interact with each other to create a
					unified rhythmic effect.
					<br />
					<br />
					Though the word groove has a long history in the field of music making
					its occurrence in the books on popular music theory is rare. The
					second edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz defines groove as
					"a persistently repeated pattern". Jeff Pressing a psychologist and
					music researcher says groove can be defined as a kinetic framework for
					reliable prediction of events and time pattern communication. Let's
					understand what that means here. Kinetic refers to the physical
					movement of motion. Groove transfers energy from musicians to
					listeners through predictable patterns that generate momentum.
					Perceptual and productive rivalries are established against a stable
					framework. What are rivalries here? It is a neurological phenomenon
					where competing ideas form in your brain for a sensory stimulus. It
					means that while a single stimuli is presented the perceived image or
					sound in this case will switch between two distinct perceptive ideas
					of what the stimulus is. An optical illusion is a good example of a
					visual rivalry. Ok what about perceptual rivalries? This means you
					hear the music in two different ways at once. One example is Queen's
					We Will Rock You song pattern: Stomp-Stomp-CLAP, Stomp-Stomp-CLAP. Is
					the clap the main beat or the stomps? So what's a productive rivalry?
					Also called Binocular rivalry, in this phenomenon the brain alternates
					between perceiving two different stimuli to each sensory organ even if
					those stimuli are not inherently conflicting. In music this means your
					head can move to one beat but your foot or hips can move to some other
					beat.
					<br />
					<br />
					Another definition comes from musicologist Richard Middleton who
					summarises groove as understanding of rhythmic patterning that
					underlines its role in producing the characteristic rhythmic feel of a
					piece, a feel created by repeated framework within which variation can
					then take place.
					<br />
					Ethnomusicologist Charles Keil who has gone so far to introduce a new
					branch of study called "groovology" based on this theory of
					"Participatory Discrepancies" or PDs. For him groove is a process
					rather than a thing, a verb than a noun. Keil acknowledges the
					traditional view that expressivity of music and its meaning is rooted
					in its musical syntax especially in the Western art music repertoire
					yet he claims that syntax does not explain the expressivity of many
					other forms of music performance around the world. His idea of
					expressivity of music includes substantial proportions of
					improvisation (eg. Jazz) and spontaneity, music that is a process and
					music that has groove i.e. music that motivates a motor response in
					listeners. In his book published together with Steven Feild
					<span class="italic">Music Grooves</span>, he says participatory
					discrepancies - deviations from precise metronomic timing
					relationships as a central source of groove. He says "everything has
					to be a bit out of time, a little out of pitch to groove" and is
					therefor the fundamentally imperfect result of a collaborative
					process. These subtle timing variations can include:
					<br />
					- Playing slightly ahead and/or behind the beat.
					<br />
					- Varying the duration of notes
					<br />
					- Shifting accents within rhythmic patterns.
					<br />
					- Creating micro timing differences between instruments.
					<br />
					These discrepancies aren't random but meaningful expressive choices
					that create tension and release. They are what makes music alive,
					rhythmic, and engaging rather than mechanically precise.
					<br />
					<br />
					something common comes out from all of the definitions mentioned
					above. Just rhythm on its own quickly gets boring unless it is
					complemented in the foreground by group of tones that go against the
					meter. In regards to all of these definitions we can make two
					assumptions:
					<br />
					- Groove is a state where the actions feel automatic and few or no
					attentional resources are required for executing action sequences.
					<br />
					- Being in groove induces a state of positive effect.
