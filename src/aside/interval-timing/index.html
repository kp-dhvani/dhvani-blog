					For centuries, humans have thought about time, its nature and how we
					process times in our minds. Time perception is part of the human
					experience yet the complete neural basis of time perception is still
					unknown. One of the most fundamental variables that organisms have to
					quantify in order to survive is temporality or time. Our brains have
					to develop a sense of time to do activities like talk, sing, run,
					perform activities in a group, drive, etc. Humans unfortunately do not
					posses a sensory organ to detect time like we do for audio and visual
					sensory input yet we have a sense of time. Time thus is not a material
					object of the world for which we could have a sensory organ to sense
					it. On a scale from microseconds on one side and circadian rhythm on
					the other, temporal information guides our behaviour. A 12 order
					magnitude is covered by this scale.

				<p class="underline">Microsecond Scale</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Information processing in the microseconds is needed for binaural
					hearing and echolocation. For binaural hearing the microsecond scale
					is used by the auditory system to determine the differences in time in
					the action potentials for the two ears called as
					<span class="italic">interaural delay</span> to determine the spatial
					origin of the sound. The sound will arrive slightly earlier for the
					near ear usually in the order of 600-700&mu;s because of the natural
					interaural time difference (ITD).
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Milliseconds Range</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Intercal timing ranging from 200-1000ms involves a broad spectrum of
					activities ranging from collision avoidance, object interception,
					speech perception, motion processing, execution and processing music,
					coordinating fine movements, etc. The temporal processing in this
					range is quite sophisticated yet poorly understood on how the neural
					processing works to make it happen.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Seconds to Minute Scale</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Temporal processing in this range depends on conscious and cognitive
					control and is involved in foraging, decision making, sequential motor
					performance, arithmetic, associative learning, etc. Timing in this
					scale forms the contextual framework through which our behaviour is
					mapped onto the external world.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Circadian Rhythms</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					The biological timing that organises the daily environmental
					oscillations every 24 hours is known as the circadian clock. The two
					major functions of this clock are:
					<br />
					- Prepare your body for what's coming next based on the time of day.
					It optimises the temporal manifestations of different biological
					activities during the day by anticipating of recurring fluctuations in
					the environment.
					<br />
					- Prevent biological conflicts by timing different processes to not
					interfere with each other. Eg. release growth hormones only while
					sleeping and not during the day when you need energy for activities.
					<br />
					The circadian rhythm in mammals is governed by a complex network of
					<span class="italic">cellular molecular oscillators</span> distributed
					throughout the brain and peripheral tissues. The master clock is in
					the brain in this region known as
					<span class="italic">hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei</span> (SCN).
				</p>
				<div class="flex justify-center my-10">

					/>
				</div>
				<p class="mb-5">
					It synchronises the internal clock with the external light-dark cycle
					of the day. The internal circadian clock in mammals possesses a rhythm
					with an approximate 24 hour period and the synchronising signal is
					light. The SCN acts as a relay between the external light-dark cycle
					and the internal timing system. So, the peripheral clocks are governed
					directly by the SCN that controls the activities like feeding, body
					temperature, hormone release, etc.

					Different timing mechanism for different timing behaviours?
				</p>
				<p>
					The word <span class="italic">timing</span> can have the connotation
					of either <span class="italic">how long</span> an event lasts or
					<span class="italic">when</span> an event occurs. So, the internal
					clocks should have the ability to encode the elapsed time from a
					stimulus or process such as the time between the notes in a song,
					along with the capacity to measure remaining time for an action where
					the system should select a precise moment for doing something for an
					accurate result like when a batsman hits a cricket ball.
					<br />
					Our brains need to compute time from different modalities of sensory
					stimulus or when involved in rhythmic activities like music and
					dancing or when marking the elapsed time from an event or as the time
					remaining for an action. So, some key elements of temporal processing
					include the time scale being quantified, the modality of the stimuli
					guiding the time perception, whether the time is being measured for a
					movement or perceptual decision, whether the task involves single or
					multiple intervals, whether the timing generated is external or
					internal.

				<p class="underline">Cognitive model of time</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					Research from experimental psychology, clinical neuropsychology, and
					neuroimaging have produced an extensive literature on the cognitive
					mechanism of temporal processing. Cognitive models distinguish time
					perception with two fundamental perspectives:
					<span class="italic">prospective</span> and
					<span class="italic">retrospective</span>.
					<br />
					The prospective model says that an observer judges the duration of an
					interval that is presently being experienced. This model assumes of an
					"internal clock" with a pacemaker producing a sequence of time units
					that are fed into an accumulator. Here the time units produced are
					only registered when attention is directed to time. This makes
					prospective model dual in nature as the observer has to switch focus
					between temporal and non-temporal processes while the accumulator
					collects the time units generated by the pacemaker in the background.
					This model is also called the
					<span class="italic">Scalar Expectancy Theory</span>. An internal
					clock, working memory, a reference memory, and a decision process is
					required as per this model. The onset of a stimulus causes the switch
					to connecting the pacemaker and the accumulator to close allowing the
					pulses or the ticks of the inner clock to flow. The offset of the
					stimulus causes the switch to open, cutting the connection. The
					resulting pulses represent the elapsed time and is sent to the working
					memory. While timing an event the value in the working memory i.e. the
					current time is compared to the value in the long term reference
					memory i.e. the expected time. When the two values are close an action
					is initiated; when they are far apart the action is stopped. To make
					the comparison, the ratio of the two values are computed; when the
					ratio is less than a certain value an action is initiated else no
					action is initiated. The key point here is that a ratio of the two
					values is compared instead of subtracting the absolute values i.e.
					timing precision is relative to the size of the interval being timed.
					Hence the name "Scalar". For eg. when timing a 10 second interval the
					observed value might be precise upto 1 sec but if timing a 100 second
					interval the precision might be about 10 seconds. However, a cyclical
					pattern can be observed here. You need a reference memory to compare
					the durations and these references are created from previous duration
					experiences which themselves require duration judgments with
					references that do not exist yet. How do you compare your first
					duration when you have no stored pulse counts? The model works well
					for explaining timing behaviour but struggles with the foundation
					question of how temporal quality emerges initially. Clocks, were
					developed on the original capacity we have to subjectively experience
					time; they are a product of our mental, physical, and psychological
					capabilities. We created the devices like clocks, chronometers,
					watches, etc. because we could already perceive duration, sequence,
					and temporal flow. Clocks produce a measurable time for us, it's a
					product of the device; it's circular to explain how time works by
					pointing to a clock and how it works.

				<p class="underline">Neural model of time</p>
				<p>
					Currently we have two opposite models how these different timing
					stimuli are processed in the brain. The hypothesis of the first model
					is that there is a common mechanism that processes temporal
					information across all the behaviours. This hypothesis is supported by
					classical psychophysical (a branch of psychology that studies relation
					between physical stimuli and mental phenomena) observations eg.
					perception and motor production share common timing mechanisms and by
					brain lesion and functional imaging studies. On the other hand the
					hypothesis from the opposing model says the temporal processing is
					ubiquitous and localised depending on the behavioural context. It
					suggests that time processing does not have a dedicated parts in the
					brain but rather a property that emerges from the normal functioning
					of whatever brain networks are involved in the task. This view is
					supported by modeling, brain slice recordings, and new psychophysical
					approaches. There is an emerging third view which suggests the
					existence of partially distributed timing mechanism, integrated by
					main core structures of the cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia circuit
					(CBGT) and the areas of the brain that are selectively engaged in the
					behavioural task and is supported via recent psychophysical studies
					and functional imaging meta analysis.

				<p class="mb-5">
					The psychophysics of temporal quantification started as early as the
					late 19<sup>th</sup> century. While the study o the neural basis of
					timing is quite recent so there is still not enough evidence to accept
					or refute any of the hypotheses mentioned above.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Sensory Timing</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					All organisms extract temporal information from stimuli of all sensory
					channels even if there is no time sensory organ. We are still not sure
					how time is computed from the activation of different sensory systems
					nor where is the temporal information extracted in this hierarchy of
					sensory systems. But let's first understand the the general functional
					arrangement of the auditory, visual and somatosensory (relating to a
					sensation such as pressure, pain, or warmth which can happen anywhere
					in the body) systems that are involved in the temporal processing
					particularly in the hundreds of milliseconds range. These sensory
					systems have the following commonalities: the sensory trigger of a
					signal of the physical information into action potentials in the
					sensory receptor; the projection of this information through the
					thalamus to the primary sensory areas of the cerebral cortex; the
					processing of the different aspects of the stimuli in the cortical
					circuits of the brain; and finally the use of high order sensory
					processing for perception, learning, memory and voluntary motor
					action. Initially, time information could be extracted from the
					trigger of the signal of the sensory input in the first relays of the
					sensory systems involved. Not just that various studies show that
					auditory modality has the strongest ability to extract temporal
					information in the range of tens of milliseconds across the first
					relays of the sensory processing which tells us that time is a
					fundamental behavioural parameter for audition.
					<br />
					For vision, duration tuned cells show up in the first nodes of the
					visual pathway. Some of the neurons respond best to stimuli that last
					a specific amount of time. The time range is between 50 to 400
					milliseconds. Interestingly, no such tuned cells were found in thr
					thalamus for visual processing which suggests that time processing in
					visual stimuli is localised in the first relays of neurons. However,
					research has shown that temporal processing observed psychophysical
					tasks in humans is more precise and accurate when the intervals are
					defined by auditory than visual or tactile stimuli.
					<br />
					Another important property of temporal processing is that the
					perceived time is affected by whether the intervals in the stimuli are
					empty or filled. For auditory input empty stimuli could look like:
					click - silence - click. For visual stimuli it could look like flicker
					- darkness - flicker. The filled stimuli for auditory stimulus could
					be a stream of noise or tone and for visual it could be just a flash
					for the whole interval. Studies have shown that intervals with filled
					stimuli feel longer than the stimuli with empty intervals. No single
					mechanism fully explains the effect, it is the result of fundamental
					differences in how the brain processes temporal information when
					additional sensory processing is required versus when timing can
					operate in isolation.
					<br />
					The temporal processing hence seems to be dependent on a specialised
					group of cells in the early nodes of the sensory processing that are
					tuned to the duration of auditory or visual stimuli. Also, the
					multimodal temporal processing of tens of hundreds of milliseconds is
					anatomy dependent (eyes vs ears) and audition clearly has an advantage
					in the perception of passage of time.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Time Perception</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
					The integration of duration information across all the sense seems to
					be dependent on the exstratriate cortex of the brain which is the
					region next to the occipital cortex which processes visual sensory
					information. The recognition and perception of passage of time across
					the senses can be used for planning a motor action, discriminating
					between intervals of time, categorisation tasks, etc. Multiple studies
					have been do to see how the brain performs interval learning and
					discrimination on multiple sensory modalities like audition and
					somatosensory stimuli. Subjects were trained to recognise a 70-200ms
					interval between stimuli and it was observed that intensive learning
					can generalise across modalities, skin location, and brain hemisphere.
					In one of the studies the subjects were trained on a base interval of
					75ms and a target interval of 125ms and the discrimination of the
					intervals improved significantly on training of the two intervals. In
					fact interval training for somatosensory stimuli on one hand was
					generalised for the same interval on the other untrained hand. For
					auditory stimuli the learning transfer was dependent on improved
					temporal processing and not on more efficient memory or decision
					process. These findings not only support the view of a centralised or
					a partially overlapping distributed timing mechanism but also the
					existence of duration specific circuitry for temporal processing.
					Because of the learning the timing signals from the early cortical
					areas of the brain are sent to the core timing network of the brain
					which improves the efficiency of processing temporal information. fMRI
					studies show an early and late visual and auditory areas are activated
					during the perception of interval tasks. Overall, we see the idea
					emerging that temporal processing is a complex phenomena which
					involves cortical and subcortical structures of the brain.
				</p>
				<p class="underline">Motor Timing</p>
				<p>
					Time interval processing in the range of milliseconds is required for
					various complex activities like speech perception and production,
					perception and execution of music and dance, performance of sports,
					etc. Time in music comes in different sequences and of different
					durations; regular interval of different durations on a pulse forms a
					meter. The ability to interpret the beat and rhythm helps us
					appreciate music and be able to dance to it. Music and dance are
					complex behaviour dependent on processing intricate loops of timing
					information from the sensory organs or generating internally timed
					motor sequences in case of dancing. Various fMRI studies have shown
					activation in cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia circuit when involved in
					time perception activities which are the same areas that get activated
					in planning and executing motor activities. This region of the brain
					also includes medial premotor areas (premotor cortex) and
					presupplementary motor areas (motor cortex). These studies provide an
					evidence for CBGT being a core element of the timing network for
					interval processing from the provided stimuli however, there seems to
					be no evidence for its involvement in capturing the temporal
					resolution during temporal processing.
					<br />
					Studies show the involvement of medial premotor areas and the
					neostriatum (a cluster of nuclei in subcortical basal ganglia) for
					duration tuning on a set of tapping tasks done with monkeys. Such
					studies again confirm the existence of interval tuning in the core
					timing network of the brain. Interval tuning here means that there are
					a set of neurons in the CBGT tuned to a specific interval (let's say
					100ms) where they fire with the highest intensity. For different
					tapping intervals and modalities (visual cue, auditory cue) the
					neurons showed an affinity for their tuned interval across all the
					tasks. For instance a neuron tuned to 200ms stayed tuned to 200ms
					whether the monkey was
					<br />
					- tapping to visual cues
					<br />
					- tapping to auditory cues
					<br />
					- tapping internally without a cue
					<br />
					- making single or multiple taps
					<br />
					This confirms the existence of tuned neurons which are context
					independent for temporal processing in the CBGT. It's like having an
					universal stopwatch for 200ms detection. In contrast, the neurons in
					the lower level sensory processing (auditory and visual) are modality
					specific, which means visual neurons only respond to visual stimuli
					and auditory neurons only respond to auditory stimuli and hence
					localised temporal resolution and processing.
					<br />
					In various experimental psychology studies it was observed that the
					temporal processing improved significantly when there are repetitions
					of the standard interval presented to the subjects.
					<span class="italic">Just Noticeable Difference</span> is the amount
					some aspect of a stimulus must be changed in order for a difference to
					be noticeable, detectable at least half the time between two stimuli.
					The standard interval is the interval chosen for various tasks in the
					studies mentioned above. Multiple exposure to the standard interval
					improved the accuracy of the subjects whether they were performing
					visual or auditory tasks for time interval perception or temporalised
					tapping. Recordings of the cells in premotor areas of monkeys
					producing multiple intervals in a sequence showed temporal improvement
					possibly due to an increase in the perceived or executed intervals.
					The interval tunes cells in the CBGT showed a multiplicative scaling
					i.e a proportional increase in their response for more produced
					intervals. The decrease in the variance of the temporal information
					could be because of the discharge rate of the interval tuned cells.
					The discharge rate is the rate at which the neurons fire and is
					measured in spiker per seconds or hertz (Hz). Higher the discharge
					rate higher the neuron signal which leads to better noise to signal
					ratio improving the overall accuracy.
