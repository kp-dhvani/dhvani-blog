						I bought my first ever synthesiser a couple of months ago and have
						been playing around with synthesising sounds learning the basics of
						sound design. To have some structure in my research and learning I
						started with synthesising percussive sounds like kick drums,
						cymbals, hi-hats, etc. Synthesising a kick drum sound is one thing
						but adding movement to the sound on its own a separate technique
						which is not really possible with my Moog Mavis.
						<br />
						Moog Mavis is a perfect synth to learn the basics of sound
						synthesis. It is a semi modular synth packed with a lot features
						like its VCO with pulse width modulation, waveform mixing, 24dB Low
						Pass Filter, audio rate LFO (which can act as a second VCO), 24
						point patch bay which helps extend the base functions to a greater
						extent, 4 stage (ADSR) envelope generator, wavefolding circuit,
						allowing for additive synthesis, patchable sample and hold circuit
						etc. It does lack certain capabilities like a noise source,
						sequencer, modifying the slope of the filter, fewer modulation
						options, etc. But given the price of the Mavis it does pack a lot of
						functionalities and is an excellent synth for getting into sound
						synthesis.
						<br />
						Mavis primarily uses subtractive synthesis to generate sounds and I
						was able to generate kick drum sounds by skipping the primary VCO
						and using LFO as the source of my sound and using the attenuator to
						controls how much the envelope affects the pitch with some extra
						processing like compression on Ableton but not having an ability to
						trigger the sound on its own limits the exploration I can do in
						designing the sound.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						In comes the sequencer. But first what is a sequencer anyway?
						<br />
						In sound synthesis we have oscillators, filters, amplifiers that
						create and shape the sound. These modules give us the ability to
						craft the timbre of the sound but to create music out of the sound
						we need to control when the sound starts and stops. Music is just
						organised sound. In the musical structure sounds start, repeat, and
						stop and start again. We also need a way to program in what pitch to
						play and how they change over time. A sequencer helps us program
						these attributes of a sound. Sequencers tell the synthesiser modules
						when to trigger sounds and what parameters to change for that
						trigger. The most basic way a sequencer helps in synthesis is
						through gate signals. A gate signal acts like an on/off switch. It
						is one of the main signal types that are passed around in modular
						synthesisers. It jumps to high level which is typically 5 volts when
						a sequencer jumps to the next step in the sequence. When a gate
						signal is applied to an envelope generator, the start of the gate
						tells the envelope to go through its stages Attack and Decay, while
						the gate stays high the envelope stays in its Sustain stage and when
						the gate is low the envelope moves to the Release stage. Beyond this
						sequencers can also help control other parameters of the sound.
						While one sequence controls the sound trigger through envelope
						generators other sequence can control the pitch of the sound and
						another can control the cutoff filter through something called
						Control Voltage (CV). So sequencers play a crucial role in defining
						the overall sound coming out of a synthesiser and adding a movement
						to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Moog Mavis does not come with a sequencer. Moog has other synths
						like its DFAM (drum machine), Mother 32 which come with their own
						sequencers built into the machines. But we are in the world of
						modular synthesis. There is a reason it is called modular and that
						gives endless possibilities to explore. We can build our modules and
						hook into our modular synthesiser setup. But how do we even create a
						sequencer? Do we get small resistors, transistors, capacitors,
						breadboards and bunch of wires to make a sequencer circuit? Of
						course we can.

						Though I have studied electronics in my year 11, 12, and first year
						of engineering I am more of a software engineer than an electrical
						engineer so I found a way to do less electronics and more
						programming to build my step sequencer.
						<br />
						Electro Smith makes hardware and software tools for audio
						applications. They are particularly known for their creating the
						Daisy platform which has become an important tool in modern DIY
						audio electronics community. Their flagship product, the Daisy, is a
						powerful microcomputer platform specifically designed for audio
						applications. Think of it as a specialized "brain" for audio devices
						it's like having a tiny but powerful music computer that can be
						programmed to process and generate sound in various ways. Daisy
						supports a number of languages including C++, Arduino, and Max/MSP,
						etc. to program audio on it.
						<br />
						This is Electro Smith Daisy Pod. It takes the daisy microprocessor
						and adds a set of physical controls and connections like LEDs,
						switch buttons, knobs, etc. to quickly get started with audio
						programming.

						So here is my setup for a simple 8 step sequencer which for now only
						sends a gate output using a daisy pod:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>Use the encoder to step through each step in the sequence</li>
						<li>Press the encoder to enter or leave edit mode</li>
						<li>
							Once in edit mode use the switch number 2 to turn on/off a step in
							the sequence
						</li>
						<li>For every on step in the sequence LED 2 turns green</li>
						<li>
							LED 1 shows 8 different colours for each step in the sequence
						</li>
						<li>Use knob 1 to change the tempo of the step</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Here is the simple c++ method running on Daisy Pod to generate a
						gate signal for steps in a sequence:

						Tempo refers to the overall speed or pace of the sound/music. If you
						were to tap your foot to the music it's how fast or slow these
						regular movements would be. Tempo is measures in Beats Per Minute
						(BPM). Each beat represents a quarter not and this comes from
						western classical music notation where the quarter note is
						considered the basic unit of time. When you say "1-2-3-4" to keep
						time, each number typically represents a quarter note. However in
						most modern electronic music the most common rhythmic subdivision is
						the eighth note. This is because:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>
							Most electronic drum patterns are built around a fundamental
							rhythm called the "sixteenth note grid," where a 4/4 bar is
							divided into 16 equal parts. The kick drum often falls on quarter
							notes (beats 1-2-3-4), while the hi-hats typically play eighth
							notes (the "and" between each beat). This creates the
							characteristic "boom-tss-boom-tss" pattern heard in electronic
							music.
						</li>
						<li>
							When you hear a basic house music pattern, what feels like the
							basic "pulse" is usually happening at the eighth note level. The
							iconic electronic music rhythm:
						</li>
						<li>Kick on the quarter notes (1-2-3-4)</li>
						<li>Open hi-hat on the eighth notes between (the "and" counts)</li>
						<li>Snare/clap on beats 2 and 4</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						So when we make a step sequencer with 8 steps, having each step
						represent an eighth note means:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>One complete sequence = 4 quarter notes = 1 bar of music</li>
						<li>Each step = 1/8 of the bar = eighth note</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This is an important piece of conversion we need to make in our code
						to correctly calculate the tempo and the length of each step for
						that tempo.
						<br />
						To calculate the frequency of each step we divide the current tempo
						by 60 to convert BPM to beats per second and divide by 2 again
						because without the last division each step would last a full beat
						i.e. a quarter note.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that we know how long is each step, let's emit a gate signal for
						each active step in the sequence. Moog Mavis Gate input works with
						the Eurorack modular voltage levels and audio interface voltage
						levels. In a Eurorack system, gate signals typically swing between
						-5V and +5V or even up to +8V. However, the Mavis is more flexible -
						it can also work with the lower voltage levels that come from audio
						interfaces.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Daisy Pod works with an audio sample rate of 48kHz. In each audio
						sample the phase increases by
						<br />
						<span class="italic">1.0 / 48000 = 0.0000208333...</span>
						The phase variable acts like a musical metronome that counts from 0
						to 1. When it reaches 1, several things happen:
					</p>
					<ol class="list-decimal pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>The phase resets back to 0 (phase -= 1.0f)</li>
						<li>
							The sequencer moves to the next step:
							<span class="italic"
								>sequencer.currentStep = (sequencer.currentStep + 1) %
								NUM_STEPS;</span
							>
						</li>
						<li>
							The gate output updates based on whether the new step is active
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						During each step, phase goes from 0 to 1. Checking if phase is below
						0.5 essentially divides each step into two equal parts. Think of it
						like splitting a musical note into its "pressed" and "released"
						states and when it's below 0.5, the gate is high (if that step is
						active). This creates a perfect 50% duty cycle meaning the gate
						signal is high for exactly half of each step's duration.
						<br />
						<br />
						At 120 BPM, here's what happens in real time:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>Each beat represents a quarter note</li>
						<li>
							One beat takes 0.5 seconds (60 seconds / 120 beats = 0.5 seconds
							per beat)
						</li>
						<li>
							The division by 2 means each step represents an eighth note, not a
							quarter note.
						</li>
						<li>
							At 120 BPM, each eighth note (step) takes 0.25 seconds (half of a
							quarter note)
						</li>
						<li>
							For each step Gate is high for 0.125 seconds (half of 0.25) and
							Gate is low for 0.125 seconds
						</li>
						<li>
							sequence has 8 steps, so one complete sequence takes: 8 steps ×
							0.25 seconds = 2 seconds total
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<p>
						In musical terms, if we are in 4/4 time (the most common time
						signature), this means:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-2">
						<li>
							Each bar (measure) contains 4 quarter notes or 8 eighth notes
						</li>
						<li>Your 8-step sequence exactly fills one bar of music</li>
						<li>Every 2 seconds, the sequence completes one full bar</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-5">
						By using phase this way is it creates perfectly timed transitions
						regardless of the tempo. Whether you are running at 40 BPM or 340
						BPM the phase accumulation automatically adjusts to keep everything
						in sync with your audio rate, preventing any timing jitter that
						could affect the rhythmic precision.
						<br />
						<br />
						Once we know when to output a signal based on the phase we output a
						voltage of +0.95V and -0.95V. In digital audio systems like your
						Daisy Pod, there is a concept called "headroom" - a small safety
						margin below the absolute maximum voltage the system can handle. The
						maximum theoretical voltage range in most audio systems is ±1.0
						volt, but using exactly ±1.0 could cause problems.
						<br />
						First, using 0.95 provides a small buffer against clipping.
						Digital-to-analog converters (DACs) can behave unpredictably when
						pushed to their absolute limits. They might introduce distortion or
						fail to reach the exact maximum voltage consistently. By staying
						slightly below the maximum, you ensure the signal remains clean and
						reliable.
						<br />
						Second, real-world electronic components have manufacturing
						tolerances and slight variations. The 5% headroom (the difference
						between 0.95 and 1.0) helps accommodate these variations. It's like
						leaving a little extra space when parking your car - it's better to
						have a small margin of safety than to risk bumping into something.
						<br />
						Third, when signals pass through multiple stages of audio equipment
						(like from my Daisy Pod to the Mavis), each stage might introduce
						tiny amounts of gain or amplification. If I started at exactly ±1.0V
						and any stage added even a tiny bit of gain, I would get clipping.
						Starting at ±0.95V gives the signal room to breathe through the
						entire signal chain.
					</p>
					<p>
						This gives a simple step sequencer which outputs a gate signal for
						each active step in the sequence. Next I'll be adding the
						functionality to output a pitch CV to change the pitch of each
						active step in the sequence.
						<br />
