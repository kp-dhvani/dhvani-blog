					<p>
						Logarithms are used in various fields, such as mathematics, science,
						and computer science, to express exponential relationships. The base
						of a logarithm determines how the logarithm behaves.
					</p>

					<p class="underline">Base 10 (Common Logarithm)</p>
					<p>
						The common logarithm is the logarithm with
						<span class="highlight">base 10</span>, often written as
						<code>log(x)</code> or <code>log<sub>10</sub>(x)</code>.
						<br />
						Scaling Large Numbers: It's used for compressing large numbers,
						making them easier to interpret (e.g. in scientific notation).
					</p>

					<h3>Example:</h3>
					<p class="mb-5">
						<code>log<sub>10</sub>(1000) = 3</code> because
						<code>10<sup>3</sup> = 1000</code>.
					</p>

					<p class="underline">Base e (Natural Logarithm)</p>
					<p>
						The natural logarithm is the logarithm with base <i>e</i> >, where
						<i>e</i> â‰ˆ 2.71828, often written as <code>ln(x)</code>.
						<br />
						Mathematical Significance: <i>e</i> arises naturally in many areas
						of mathematics, especially with continuous growth or decay.
						<br />
						Calculus and Derivatives:The function
						<code>e<sup>x</sup></code> has the special property that it is its
						own derivative, making it crucial for continuous processes.
					</p>

					<h3>Example:</h3>
					<p>
						<code>ln(e) = 1</code> because <code>e<sup>1</sup> = e</code>.
					</p>

					<h3>Common Applications:</h3>
					<ul class="mb-5">
						<li>
							Exponential growth and decay (e.g. population growth, radioactive
							decay).
						</li>
						<li>Finance (e.g. compound interest, continuous compounding).</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="underline">Base 2 (Binary Logarithm)</p>
					<p>
						The binary logarithm is the logarithm with base 2, often written as
						<code>log<sub>2</sub>(x)</code>.
					</p>

					<p>Why Base 2?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Computer Science: Base 2 is used because computers operate on
							binary, which involves powers of 2 (0 and 1).
						</li>
						<li>
							Doubling and Halving: Base 2 is used to measure data storage,
							algorithm complexity, and more in computing.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Example:</h3>
					<p>
						<code>log<sub>2</sub>(16) = 4</code> because
						<code>2<sup>4</sup> = 16</code>.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Computer science (e.g., binary search, data structures).</li>
						<li>Data storage (e.g. bits, bytes).</li>
						<li>Cryptography (e.g. encryption algorithms).</li>
					</ul>
