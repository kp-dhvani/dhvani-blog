						What is sound?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Sound is nothing but a result of pressure variations in the air (or
						any medium), caused by disturbances such as vibrations in our
						surroundings. For eg. if you hit a tuning fork it creates a
						disturbance in the air pressure and when that disturbance reaches us
						our brains translate that change in pressure to sound. Sound is a
						natural acoustic phenomenon of vibrations moving usually through air
						(or any kind of medium) to our ears.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ok let's try to visualise what happens when a tuning fork is hit.
					</p>
					<div class="flex justify-center my-10">
						<img
							src="/assets/tuning_fork.png"
							alt="tuning fork compression and rarefaction"
							class="max-w-full h-auto"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						When the prongs of a tuning fork vibrate, they disturb the air
						particles around them. When the prongs move apart, they push against
						the neighboring air particles, causing compression. In this
						compressed region, the particles are forced closer together,
						increasing the air pressure. This compression represents the "push"
						of the wave but does not involve air particles traveling with the
						wave only their vibrations about their mean positions. When the
						prongs move back to their original position, the compressed air
						expands, causing the air particles to move slightly away from each
						other, resulting in rarefaction a region of lower pressure. The
						particles return to their original positions but continue to
						oscillate, contributing to the wave's propagation. Air particles
						don't move with the sound wave because sound is a mechanical wave
						(meaning it needs a medium to travel), and mechanical waves transfer
						<span class="font-bold">energy</span>, not matter.
					</p>
					<div class="flex justify-center my-10">
						<img
							src="/assets/tuning_fork_2.gif"
							alt="tuning fork compression and rarefaction gif"
							class="max-w-full h-auto"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						Because of this motion of the air particles due to the vibrations
						from the tuning fork there are regions where the air particles are
						compressed together and other regions where the air particles are
						spread apart. These regions are called compressions and rarefactions
						respectively. The alternate compression and rarefaction form on the
						same point, there is no migration of the particles. Sound results
						from this mechanical wave caused by the back and forth movement of
						the particles through a medium.

						If you could see sound waves, it would look more like what happens
						when you blow up a large beach ball. Imagine that you blow into a
						beach ball and it expands outwards in a spherical shape. When you
						take your mouth off the nozzle to take another breath the ball
						slightly deflates. As you blow the next breath into it the ball
						expands again and slightly deflates when you take the next breath,
						and so on until the ball is completely inflated. In a similar manner
						sound propagates away from the source in a sphere moving outward and
						then recoiling inward and then outward and so on.

						How do we perceive sounds?
					</h1>
					<p>
						On the level of physics what we call sound is a vibration or
						referring an old word <span class="italic">verberation</span>. This
						is a wave that following the shaking movement of one or more sources
						propagate and reaches our ears where it gives rise to auditory
						sensations. Physically speaking sound is the shaking movement of the
						medium in question. Sound propagates in concentric cirlces similar
						to ripples seen on throwing a rock into calm waters. In the air the
						verberation propagates at a speed of approximately 343 meters per
						second. It was only at the beginning of the nineteenth century that
						this average speed of sound which varies slightly relative to
						pressure and temperature was able to be calculated. In water the
						wave propagates considerably faster (1500 m/s). Sound also travels
						through hard material and this is the reason why it is so hard to
						soundproof apartments that are located on top of the other. Sound in
						the <span class="italic">physical</span> sense has only two
						characteristics: <span class="underline">frequency</span> the number
						of oscillations (or vibrations) per second and
						<span class="underline">pressure amplitude</span> which correlates
						to the magnitude of the oscillation. Frequency is perceived as pitch
						and the amplitude is perceived as sonic intensity (loudness). All of
						the other perceived characteristics of sound are produced by
						variations of frequency and amplitude over time. The sound
						propagation takes place in every direction and it weakens in
						proportion to the square of the distance traveled. There is a
						reflection when the verberation encounters a surface that does not
						absorb it completely and returns a portion of it like a bouncing
						ball. Weh we hear sound via direct propagation from the source and a
						reflected sound the lag between the direct sound and reflected sound
						combine to produce <span class="italic">reverberations</span>. When
						a sound wave encounters an obstacle a portion will bypass it and
						this is called diffraction. Diffraction is what makes acoustic
						isolation difficult to achieve.

						The ears detect, analyse, and classify biologically interesting
						sounds and construct a model of auditory scene that surrounds us.
						The auditory system is attuned not only to listen to certain sounds
						but to ignore sounds that are not biologically relevant. Such sounds
						include ambient noises and the effects of sound reflection,
						refraction, diffusion which can distort the incoming sound. Imagine
						that you stretch a pillowcase tightly across the opening of a bucket
						and people throw balls at it from different distances. Each person
						can throw as many balls as they like and as often they like. Now
						your job is to figure out just by looking at how the pillowcase
						moves uop and down, how many people are there, who they are, and
						whether they are walking towards you, away from you or are standing
						still. This is what our auditory system has to do when making
						identification of auditory objects in the world using only the
						movement of the eardrum as a guide. (Of course the brain combines
						the data received through the eyes to form a holistic model of the
						current environment.)
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						Human ear is an organ which is external and internal at the same
						time. The ear as an organ is divided into outer, middle and inner.
						The outer ear consist if the <span class="italic">pinna</span>, the
						auditory or the ear canal and the eardrum. Pinna helps with
						protection (from wind and other things that might interfere with
						audition) and <span class="italic">resonance</span>. The funnel
						shaped pinna collects sound from the environment and its shape
						modifies the arriving frequency information depending on the
						direction of the source. The pinna directs the waves towards the
						tympanic membrane and its form favours frequencies that we use in
						verbal communication. The ear canal of the human adult is on average
						7 to 8 millimeters in diameter and 2.5 to 3 centimeters deep. Its
						structure also tends to attenuate sounds that impede verbal
						communication mainly bass frequencies. Frequencies around 3000Hz are
						transferred more efficiently by the canal and we are more sensitive
						to this range of frequencies. The eardrum is bent by the force of
						arriving sound and transmits the motion to the middle ear. It
						vibrates more easily between 1-3.5kHz frequency range but transmits
						sounds to the inner ear over the entire audible frequency range. The
						ear drum and the middle ear play a crucial role in overcoming the
						mismatch between the low density air in the outer ear and the much
						of the denser fluid in the inner ear with a process called impedance
						matching. Impedance refers to the resistance a medium offers to the
						flow of energy. Air has low impedance while the fluid in the inner
						ear has high impedance. Without a mechanism to fix this mismatch
						sound waves sound waves mostly be reflected back when they hit the
						fluid in the inner ear. This would reduce the amount of sound energy
						entering the inner ear making hearing inefficient. Normally, when
						sound travels from a low impedance medium like air to a high
						impedance medium like water almost all of the acoustical energy is
						reflected. We still have very low understanding of how the eardrum
						accomplishes this task over such a wide frequency range.

						The middle ear is primarily made up of tympanic membrane and the
						series of tiny bones called
						<span class="italic">ossicles</span> that go by the names of
						"hammer" (incus), "anvil" (malleus), and "stirrup" (stapes). The
						bones function to transfer the pressure vibrations into mechanical
						vibrations which are passed along to the entrance of cochlea which
						is called the oval window. The tympanic membrane (eardrum)
						approximately one centimeter in diameter is an elastic membrane is
						in contact with these ossicles. This series of little bones transmit
						the vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear while
						amplifying the frequencies between 1000 and 4000Hz. It is here that
						the bones protect against the sounds that are too loud with a
						mechanism called acoustic reflex (also called the stapedius reflex
						or middle ear reflex). Not only does this mechanism protect us from
						loud sounds, it also dulls the loudness of our own voices when we
						speak. It involves tiny muscles attached to the ossicles that
						respond to the loud sounds by reducing the movement of the bones
						thus limiting the amount of energy transmitted to the inner ear. The
						stapedius muscle and the tensor tympani muscle contract reflexively
						with in 10-20 ms in response to loud sound pressures exceeding
						70-100dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level). When these muscles contract
						they dampen the movement of the ossciles which stiffens the
						ossicular chain reducing the transmission of the sound vibrations
						reaching the inner ear. By stiffening the ossicles, the reflex
						reduces the intensity of the sound that reaches the cochlea by
						approximately 20 decibels.

						The inner ear consists of organs that help with balance and
						audition. The audition is handled by
						<span class="italic">cochlea</span> Greek for "snail" due to its
						coiled shape. The stapes connects to the
						<span class="italic">oval window</span> at one end of the cochlea a
						fluid filled tube that connects to the auditory nerve. The other end
						is called a <span class="italic">round window</span>. The side of

						<span class="italic">scala vestibuli</span> and the side of round
						window is called <span class="italic">scala tympani</span> The two
						scala are filled with <span class="italic">perilymph</span> a fluid

						<span class="italic">scala media</span> filled with

						As the membrane moves it causes the hair cells in the organ of Corti
						to bend. The top of these hair cells have tiny hair-like structures
						called <span class="italic">stereocilia</span>. When these bend they
						open ion channels leading to an electrical signal being generated.
						There are mechano-sensitive ion channels at the tips of the
						stereocilia and these channels are sensitive to mechanical
						deformation. On bending the tips stretch which pulls the channel
						open. This allows potassium ions (K<su>+</su>) which are abundant in
						the fluid endolymph to flow into the hair cell. This influx of
						potassium ions into the hair cell caused the inside of the cell to
						become depolarized (less negatively charged) which triggers the
						opening of voltage gated calcium channels in the hair cell membrane.
						Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from the perilymph enter the hair
						cells and this leads to the release of the neurotransmitters from
						the hair cell into the spiral ganglion neuron which relay the
						signals from the inner ear to the brain stem. After the initial
						bending of the stereocilia, if the stereocilia bend back in the
						opposite direction, the ion channels close and the hair cell becomes
						hyperpolarized (more negatively charged). This shuts down the inflow
						of ions, halting the release of neurotransmitters and stopping the
						generation of action potentials.

						Ok so the ears have processed the pressure waves, turned them into
						electrical signals, and transmitted them to the brain but how does
						the brain turn these signals into sound? Let's try to make sense of
						that by taking the example of music (organised sound).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						The human brain is divided up into four lobes: the frontal,
						temporal, parietal, and occipital plus the cerebellum. The temporal
						lobe is associated with hearing and memory. The cerebellum, the
						oldest evolutionary part of the human brain going back to the
						reptilian brain is involved in emotions and the planning of
						movements. Different aspects of the music are processed by different
						parts of the brain and the brain uses functional segregation for
						processing it and uses a system of feature detectors to analyse
						specific aspects like pitch, timbre, tempo, etc. Brains are complex
						computational systems and networks of interconnected neurons perform
						computations which leads to thoughts, perceptions and ultimately
						consciousness. The average brain consists of one hundred billion
						(100,000,000,000) neurons, this is a lot of neurons but the real
						complexity arises through their connections. The formula for how n
						number of neurons can be connected to each other is 2<sup
							>(n* (n-1)/2)</sup
						>.
						<br />
						For 2 neurons there are 2 possibilities for how they can be
						connected
						<br />
						For 3 neurons there are 8 possibilities
						<br />
						For 4 neurons there are 64 possibilities
						<br />
						For 5 neurons there are 1024 possibilities
						<br />
						For 6 neurons there are 32,768 possibilities
						<br />
						The number of combinations possible for an average brain is HUGE!
						Much of the computational power comes from this enormous possibility
						for interconnections and the fact that brains are serial processors
						unlike computers which are parallel processors.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						This is how the auditory system processes sound: it doesn't have to
						wait to find out what the pitch of sound is to determine where the
						sound coming from. There are neural networks who dedicated to this
						process are separate. If one of the circuits is done processing it
						can send the information to other parts of the brain and they can
						start using that information. If the late arriving information
						affects the interpretation of the previous information our brains
						just "change their mind" and update the model of what they think of
						the incoming sound. This is called
						<span class="italic">Predictive coding</span>. As per the theory the
						brain constantly generating and updating the mental model of the
						environment to predict incoming sensory information. The theory is
						part of broader framework of
						<span class="italic">Bayesian inference</span> is the fundamental
						mechanism for perception, cognition, and action. The brain doesn't
						just passively receives information from the world but actively
						predicts it and uses incoming data to correct or refine its
						predictions.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						How does the brain figure out from the disorganised mixture of
						molecules beating again the eardrum what's out there in the
						world?<br />
						The brain uses something called as
						<span class="italic">feature extraction</span> followed by this
						other process called
						<span class="italic">feature integration</span>. The brain extracts
						low level features using specialised neural networks that decompose
						the incoming signal into information about pitch, timbre, spacial
						location, loudness, etc. Frequency (pitch) is processed by specific
						regions of the auditory cortex that correspond to different
						frequencies, known as tonotopic organization. Neurons at various
						levels in the auditory pathway are topographically arranged by their
						response to different frequencies. This organization is referred to
						as tonotopy or cochleotopy. The primary auditory cortex located in
						the temporal lobe is tonotopically organised just like cochlea for
						detecting the frequencies in the sound. Neurons in the different
						regions of the auditory cortex are sensitive to specific
						frequencies. Cells that respond to low frequencies are located in
						one region of the cortex. Cells that respond to high frequencies are
						located in another region. As we have noted previously the same
						structure is followed by cochlea to detect the frequencies in the
						sound. Volume (loudness) is perceived based on the intensity of
						neural firing in response to the electrical signals. These
						operations are carried out in parallel and can operate somewhat
						independently of one another. This sort of processing where only the
						information contained in the stimulus is considered by the neural
						circuits is called bottom up (sensory) processing. In the brain
						these attributes of music/sound are separable. The term low level
						refers to the perception of the building block attributes of sensory
						stimulus. <br />
						At the same time as feature extraction is taking place in the
						cochlea, auditory cortex, and brain stem the higher level centers of
						the brain are receiving a constant flow of information about what
						has been processed so far and this information os continuously
						updated and rewritten if needed. Centers for processing higher
						thought mostly in the frontal cortex keep receiving these updates
						and they working quickly to predict what will come next in the
						music/sound. The enjoyment we experience from music stems from the
						brain's ability to predict upcoming musical patterns, such as
						rhythm, melody, and harmony. When these predictions are confirmed,
						it creates a sense of satisfaction, making the music feel rewarding.
						This interplay between expectation and fulfillment is a key reason
						why music is so pleasurable to our brains. <br />
						The frontal lobe calculations are called top down processing and it
						can influence the lower level circuits while they are doing bottom
						up processing. The top down (cognitive) and bottom up (sensory)
						processes communicate with each other in an ongoing fashion.
						Features extracted at the lower levels are integrated at higher
						levels to form a cohesive perceptual whole. Top down and bottom up
						processing is one of the key concepts in predictive coding helping
						us to form an accurate model of our surroundings.

						The transformation of electrical signals into the conscious
						experience of sound in the brain is still one of the great mysteries
						of neuroscience. While much is known about the neural pathways
						involved in hearing the exact mechanism by which electrical signals
						are turned into the subjective perception of sound—what we call
						qualia—remains elusive. This phenomenon is part of the broader "hard
						problem of consciousness" a concept introduced by philosopher David
						Chalmers. But hopefully this article gives you a holistic view of
