					<p class="underline mb-2">A brief history of drums</p>
					<p>
						Drums play an important role in the rhythmic structure of every
						genre of music. From Kettle drums, Bass drums, Snare drums, etc. in
						the Western music to Tabla, Dhol, Mridangam, Dholak, etc. in the
						Indian music to the Persian Zerbaghali to Tanggu in China, drums
						have existed in all major civilisations in one form or the other for
						musical and non-musical purposes. One of the first earliest evidence
						of drums comes from the idiophones (produce sound via the vibration
						of the entire instrument) made from mammoth bones found in present
						day Belgium dating back to 70,000BCE. The earliest archaeological
						evidence comes from China dating back to the Neolithic period around
						5500BCE where drums were made out of hollow wood logs and covered
						with alligator skin. There is evidence of drums around the same time
						in Mesopotamia where they played an important role in the religious
						affairs of the Sumerians. Drums can be seen in the sculptural
						artwork of Greece and Rome indicating the use of the instrument for
						cultural and military endeavours. The history of drums to Europe
						through Greece trace their roots to Danbara from ancient Persia
						imported with the name Tympanon. It was also know as Tympanum in the
						Roman culture.

						The word percussion comes from the Latin word percussionem, which
						means â€œa striking, a blow.
