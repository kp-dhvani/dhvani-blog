					Oxford dictionary has 645 various definitions for the word "run". So
					how do you define it? With your feet? Nose? Rhythm suffers from the
					same problem, it means a lot of things and they are not always clearly
					distinguished even in academic discussions. Let's look at some
					definitions of rhythm found in the literature of music.
