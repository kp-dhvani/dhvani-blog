						Language is an evolutionary adaptation. The cognitive mechanisms
						like memory, attention, categorisation, all have a clear
						evolutionary purpose. But once in a while we find a behaviour or
						attribute in an organism that lacks any clear evolutionary basis.
						This occurs when evolution propagates an adaptation for a particular
						reason and something else comes along for a ride: a spandrel. The
						term comes from architecture where a designer plans for a dome to be
						held up by four arches and you'll see space between the arches not
						because it was planned but because it is a by product of the design.

						Many spandrels are put to such a good use that it makes knowing the
						fact that are they actually adaptations or not? Many artists used
						that space of spandrel make timeless beautiful art.

						Music is an auditory cheesecake. We didn't evolve a liking for
						cheesecake but we did evolve a liking for fats and sugars. We have a
						neural mechanism that rewards us when eating sugars and fats because
						in the small quantity available to our ancestors was beneficial for
						their well being. Activities like eating and mating are important
						for the survival of a specie. So they are also pleasurable to us
						because our brains rewards and encourages such behaviours. But we
						have learned to bypass the system to access those neural pathways
						for pleasure. We can eat foods that have no nutritional value, we
						can have sex without procreation, substances that exploit the normal
						pleasure receptors in the brain. None of these behaviours is
						adaptive but the pleasure centers don't know the difference. Eating
						cheesecake just happens to push pleasure buttons in our brains for
						fat and sugar. Music is simply a pleasure seeking behaviour that
						exploits one or more existing neural pathways that evolved to
						reinforce an adaptive behaviour - [linguistic communication]. Music
						pushes buttons for language ability, auditory cortex, and the motor
						control system that injects rhythm into the muscles while walking.
						Cosmologist John Barrow said that music has no role in survival of
						the specie and psychologist Dan Sperber called music an evolutionary
						parasite. Sperber believes we evolved a cognitive capacity to
						process complex sounds different in pitch and duration and this
						communication ability first arose in pre-linguistic humans. Music as
						per Sperber developed parasitically to exploit this capacity that
						had evolved for communication.
