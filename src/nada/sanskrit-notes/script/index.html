						Introduction: The script-agnostic nature of Sanskrit
					</h2>
					<p>
						Open any Sanskrit text and you might see it written in elegant
						Devanagari curves, stark Bengali angles, flowing Thai loops,
						geometric Tibetan calligraphy, from right to left or from top to
						bottom. Why? Because Sanskrit doesn't belong to any one script. It
						belongs to all of them. Sanskrit started as an oral language and
						didn't have a writing system of its own for a really long time. You
						might say that all languages are oral and that's true but for most
						of Sanskrit's life it was never written down. Sure, writing came
						much later than spoken languages and that's true for all languages.
						But here's the difference: some languages got their on custom made
						writing system. For
						<abbr title="example">eg.</abbr> Cuneiform is a writing system that
						developed in ancient Mesopotamia around 3400-3200
						<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>. The earliest cuneiform
						tablets are primarily administrative records tracking livestock,
						grain, and other commodities. Over several centuries, it evolved
						from pictographic signs into a full writing system capable of
						expressing complete texts in Sumerian and later adapted for
						Akkadian, Hittite, and other languages. Egyptian Hieroglyphs were
						invented around the same time as Cuneiform. The first attested
						script used to write Chinese was the Oracle Bone script dating back
						to 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>.
						It was already in a fully functional and mature state when we first
						saw it due to its highly abstract nature and consisting of major
						types of Chinese characters. Apart from Cuneiform, Hieroglyphs and
						Oracle Bone script were already in a mature state when we discovered
						them which clearly implies an earlier period of development of
						several hundred years.
						<br />
						So what <em>makes</em> Sanskrit different? Sanskrit, by contrast,
						was never given a purpose built script as it has always borrowed and
						adapted existing writing systems. The primary script used to write
						Sanskrit is called Devanāgari but was not invented for writing
						Sanskrit (more on this later). During it's lifecycle various scripts
						have been used to write Sanskrit. Some of the scripts used to write
						Sanskrit are:

							Sanskrit has been written in over 40 different scripts throughout

						<h2 class="underline mb-2">Devanāgari: The Abugida script</h2>
						<section>
							<p>
								Sanskrit now is primarily written in Devanāgari which is an
								Abugida script. An Abugida is a writing system where each basic
								symbol represents a consonant with an inherent vowel and form a
								consonant-vowel unit. Each unit is based on a primary consonant
								and a secondary vowel. Vowels are indicated by modifying marks
								to the base consonant using something called as diacritic marks.
								This is how it works for Devanāgari:
							</p>
							<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
								<li>
									Each letter = consonant + default vowel. In the case of
									Sanskrit the default vowel is "a".
								</li>
								<li>
									To write other vowels you add marks to the consonant. In
									Devanāgari the sign for the vowel following a consonant is
									then added to right, to the left, above or below the consonant
									sign.
								</li>
								<li>
									To write just a consonant (no vowel) you use a special mark
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Example: Base consonant क = "ka"
								<br />
								To write different vowels with क
							</p>
							<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 my-2">
								<li>कि = add mark ि for ki</li>
								<li>की = add mark ी long "ī" kī</li>
								<li>कु = add mark ु for ku</li>
								<li>कू = add mark ू for long "ū" kū</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="mb-5">
								<b>There is no sign indicating the vowel: a</b>. It is the most
								frequent vowel in Sanskrit and seemed most economical to have
								its presence <em>assumed</em> whenever no other other vowel was
								explicitly present.
								<br />
								To write just क "k" with no vowel: क्
								<br />
								In Devanāgari the mark ् to indicate the absence of a vowel is
								called a Virāma a small diagonal stroke below the consonant
								sign.
							</p>
							<p>
								This works well for when a consonant has a vowel but what
								happens when a consonant is instantly followed by another
								consonant? In this case we need to combine the two consonants in
								writing. One way to do this is to remove the downward stroke of
								the first consonant.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-5">
								The name Abugida comes from the Ethiopian Ge'ez script and is
								formed from the first four syllables
								<em>'ä, bu, gi, da</em> similar to how we say
								<em>a, b, c, d</em> in English. Abugida is one of the three
								major writing system types. In an <em>Alphabet</em> (like
								Latin/English) vowels have equal status to consonants and have
								separate letters. the word "alphabet" comes from the first two
								Greek letters <em>alpha</em> and <em>beta</em>. In an
								<em>Abjad</em> (like Arabic or Hebrew) only consonants are
								written with vowels absent or marked optionally.
								<em
									>In an Abugida like Brāhmī or Devanāgari each basic symbol
									represents a consonant with an inherent vowel and in Sanskrit
									this vowel is "a" (अ).</em
