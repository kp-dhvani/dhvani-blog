					नाद (Nāda)
					<span class="text-xs">published: 20<sup>th</sup> November 2024</span>

				<section>

						नाद comes from the root Sanskrit word नद् meaning a sound or noise,
						typically a loud or resounding one. नद् comes from the early
						Proto-Indo-European *ned- “to sound, roar, bellow”, which might be
						sound-symbolic. The root *ned- is sound-symbolic because it refers
						to things that create sounds, like roaring rivers or reeds that make
						a noise when the wind moves through them. The words connected to
						ned- are all about sound or things that make sound!

						As per Hindu cosmogony, when ब्रह्मा (Brahmā), the god of creation
						and one of the त्रिमूर्ति (Trimurti)—the holy trinity alongside
						विष्णु (Vishnu), the preserver, and शिव (Shiva), the
						destroyer—created the ब्रह्माण्ड (Brahmāṇḍ), the cosmos, there was
						nothing but sound: नाद (Nāda).
						<br />
						नाद ब्रह्मा (Nāda Brahmā) is a philosophical concept that represents
						the primordial, unstruck sound, from which all other sounds are
						believed to emanate. Nāda Brahmā could be seen as the first
						causation of sound, representing the original or primal sound that
						gives rise to all subsequent manifestations in the universe. This is
						called अनाहत नाद (Anāhat Nāda) which is heard when the Atmān
						(spirit/soul) merges with the absolute Brahmā. All other sound is
						called आहत नाद (Āhat Nāda), created by the collision of, or the
						friction between two objects. Phonetically Na indicates life breath
						and Da indicates fire. Being obtained from the combination of life
						breath and fire, it is called Nāda. When the vibrations are of a
						regular nature, then the sound obtained is melodious and useful for
						music, this sound is called Nāda. When the vibrations are irregular,
						then the sound is not melodious which is not useful for music. Āhat
						Nāda is produced by striking together of two objects whereas, Anāhat
						Nāda is experienced through knowledge without any external factor.
						Ahat Nada is related to music, Anāhat Nāda is not related to music.
						According to Mataṅga Muni a seventh century music commentator स्वर
						(swar) - the musical note is a sound that glows on its own. Swa
						(स्व) meaning self and ra means rajari - luminous. Indians thus
						associate sound and by extension music with the divine.

					<h3 class="text-lg">Origins: The Aural Tradition</h3>
					<br />
					<p class="mb-10">
						The Indian tradition is primarily an oral tradition. The holy
						scriptures of Hindus, the Vedas (वेद), are known as Śruti (श्रुति),
						meaning "that which is heard." These ancient texts were passed down
						through generations by oral recitation before being finally written
						down by वेद व्यास (Veda Vyāsa).
						<span class="italic text-sm"
							>[The Vedas are considered to be divinely revealed texts in the
							Hindu tradition, and they were not composed by any single
							individual. Instead, they are believed to have been revealed to
							the ancient sages or rishis through direct spiritual experience,
							often described as "śruti" (that which is heard). The Vedas were
							passed down orally from generation to generation and were
							eventually written down.]</span
						>
						The unique process by which this music has been kept alive over the
						centuries is through the aural guild tradition referred to as the
						गुरु-शिष्य परंपरा (Guru-Śiṣya Paramparā). The codification,
						notation, standardisation, and some form of formalisation that we
						see today only happened in the 20<sup>th</sup>
						century. Before that this knowledge was transferred from father to
						son, and from teacher to pupil by word of mouth. The origin of
						Indian music goes back to 1500BCE (~3000 years ago) with the chants
						and hymns of the Vedic people. Chants a system of musical notes
						along with the rhythmic cycles goes back to सामवेद (Sāma Veda)
						composed between 1500-1200BCE. सामवेद is called the veda of music
						and provides the foundation for Indian classical music. The सामवेद
						consists of hymns from ऋग्वेद (Ṛigveda) set to melodies. Sāman
						(सामन) refers to a type of melodic chant or hymn used in the Vedic
						rituals. It is specifically the musical aspect of the Vedic hymns.
						The Sāma Veda is largely composed of Sāman chants, which are melodic
						renderings of hymns found in the Rig Veda. सामन (Sāman) hymns were
						created by setting the verses from the Rig Veda to specific tunes or
						melodies, and these melodies were intended to be sung during Vedic
						rituals particularly sacrifices. The practice of chanting सामन was
						important because it not only conveyed the meaning of the hymns but
						also added a musical element to the rituals. The melodies and
						rhythms were believed to enhance the potency of the rituals and
						invoke the divine forces effectively. During the Vedic period music
						was used for religious ceremonies and social occasions. The music
						used for यज्ञ (Yajna) was bound by strict rules, whereas that used
						for social occasions लौकिक (Laukik) was according to the interests
						of people. Performing the rituals was the responsibility of Brāhmins
						as the songs and hymns had to sung in a proper way. Brāhmins were
						considered as suitable for the purpose who were good singers with a
						naturally melodious voice, good instrumentalists and experienced in
						the knowledge of Vedas and Vedic rituals. This training was given
						from father to son, गुरु (Guru) to शिष्य (Śiṣya), or to students of
						a गुरुकुल (Gurukul) in a group. This rule bound Vedic music can be
						called the classical form of music of Vedic period.
						<br />
						With लौकिक (Laukik) music, लोक गाथा (Lok Gāthā) and songs in praise
						of brave men and kings such as गाथाएँ (Gāthāeṅ), नराशंसी
						(Narāśaṃsī), रैभ्य (Raibhya), etc. that were used both for religious
						and social ceremonies were prevalent. Since the singers of गाथाएँ
						sang along with the वीणा (Vīṇā) instrument, they were called
						गाथागायक (Gāthāgāyak), वीणागाथिन (Vīṇāgāthin). In this period, dance
						was performed in an open surrounding before a gathering in which
						both men and women participated According to the treatise वाजसनेयी
						संहिता (Vājasneyī Saṃhitā), during this period, group dances like
						राज्जु (Rājju), अरुण (Āruṇa), प्रकृति (Prakṛti), पुष्प (Puṣpa) and
						बसंत (Basant) नृत्य (Nritya) etc. were prevalent. In this way, apart
						from the classical form which was used for religious purposes
						according to rules specified in Vedas, music was also used for
						social ceremonies according to interests of people in the Vedic
						period.
						<br />
						<br />
						The first reference to music can be credited to पाणिनि (Pāṇini), an
						ancient Indian grammarian (500BCE). His work, अष्टाध्यायी
						(Aṣṭādhyāyī), is a comprehensive treatise on Sanskrit grammar and
						includes references to various aspects of language, including
						phonetics, sound patterns, and music. contains references to musical
						sounds, rhythm, and pitch, reflecting the early recognition of the
						connection between language and sound. In his work, he mentions
						various स्वर (swar), which means sound, tone, or note. These notes
						or sounds are foundational to the study of music. The ancient
						classical text, नाट्यशास्त्र (Nāṭyaśāstra) [believed to have been
						written between 200 BCE and 200 CE however, the exact date of its
						composition is not definitively known] by भारत मुनि (Bharata Muni),
						is the foundation of numerous classical music and dance traditions
						of India. It was the first musical work written in format that
						divided music into 22 keys called श्रुति (Śruti). [more on this
						later...]
